    "description": "RapidLink Logistics, a regional delivery company, needs to optimize its daily outbound operations from its main distribution hub. Today, they have 3 delivery trucks of varying capacities and 8 high-priority parcels that must be shipped. The goal is to assign each of the 8 parcels to exactly one of the three trucks to maximize the total revenue for the day.\n\nThe total revenue is composed of two parts: a standard shipping fee for each parcel and a significant synergy bonus that is gained when specific pairs of parcels are placed in the *same* truck. These bonuses arise because certain parcels are headed to the same dense urban block or large corporate campus, allowing for a much more efficient final-mile delivery.\n\nThe capacities of the three available trucks are:\n- Truck 1: 100 kg\n- Truck 2: 120 kg\n- Truck 3: 80 kg\n\nThe details for the 8 high-priority parcels are listed below:\n| Parcel ID | Weight (kg) | Base Revenue ($) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 35 | 50 |\n| 2 | 45 | 75 |\n| 3 | 25 | 40 |\n| 4 | 50 | 80 |\n| 5 | 30 | 60 |\n| 6 | 40 | 65 |\n| 7 | 20 | 35 |\n| 8 | 55 | 90 |\n\nAdditionally, the logistics team has identified specific pairs of parcels that generate a synergy bonus if shipped in the same truck.

The company needs to meet the market demand for these two products across four quarters of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) while aiming to minimize the total annual operating costs, which include labor costs and inventory holding costs. The demand for Product A in the four quarters is 800, 600, 700, and 900 units, respectively; the demand for Product B in the four quarters is 500, 400, 600, and 300 units, respectively.Workers operate on a fixed rotation schedule: each worker works for three consecutive quarters and then takes one quarter off. To ensure that workers take their leave in the same quarter each year, workers are divided into four groups, taking leave in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. The company must decide the number of workers in each group, and this number remains constant throughout the year. Each on-duty worker, in a working quarter, can only choose to handle one type of product: either a maximum of 60 units of Product A or a maximum of 40 units of Product B. They cannot split their capacity to handle both products within the same quarter. The wage for each worker per working quarter is $600, so the annual wage for each worker is $1800.At the end of each quarter, an inventory holding cost of $70 per unit is incurred for any remaining product (either A or B) in the warehouse. It is assumed that at the beginning of the first quarter of the first year, the initial inventory for both Product A and Product B is 0 units. To simplify the model, it is assumed that at the end of the fourth quarter each year, the inventory for both Product A and Product B must be 0 units.The company's optimization objective is: to determine the number of workers in each rotation group and how to assign on-duty workers to produce Product A and Product B each quarter, in order to meet all quarterly product demands and minimize the total annual operating costs (including the total wages for all registered workers and the total inventory holding costs incurred at the end of all quarters).",

The company uses a fleet of advanced refrigerated trucks, and for a specific delivery route, one truck needs to be loaded. Each truck has strict capacity limits in four dimensions: a maximum weight of 12 tons, a total volume of 35 m³, a refrigeration power output of 40 kW, and a total cool-down time budget of 100 hours (a proxy for the energy and time required to bring goods to their optimal temperature and maintain it).\n\nThe goods are classified into 10 distinct categories. For each category, the company can choose from 5 different variants, each sourced from a different supplier and having unique characteristics. The company must select exactly one variant from each of the 10 categories to be included in the shipment with the primary goal to maximize the total profit.\n\nFurthermore, there are two special conditions for this delivery:\n1.  Product Synergy: If Variant B of Fruits (Category 1) and Variant C of Baked Goods (Category 6) are shipped together, a special packaging collaboration creates an additional bonus profit of $150.\n2.  Product Conflict: Due to the high risk of cross-contamination, shipping Variant A of Seafood (Category 5) and Variant A of Dairy (Category 3) together is forbidden.\n\nThe complete data for all available goods is as follows:\n\n| Category | Variant | Weight (t) | Volume (m³) | Power (kW) | Cool-Down (hr) | Profit ($) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1: Fruits** | A | 1.1 | 2.8 | 2.0 | 8.0 | 210 |\n| | B | 1.3 | 3.2 | 2.5 | 10.0 | 290 |\n| | C | 0.9 | 2.4 | 1.8 | 7.0 | 190 |\n| | D | 1.4 | 3.5 | 2.8 | 11.0 | 320 |\n| | E | 1.0 | 2.6 | 1.9 | 7.5 | 200 |\n| **2: Vegetables** | A | 0.8 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 160 |\n| | B | 1.0 | 2.5 | 1.5 | 6.0 | 230 |\n| | C | 0.7 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 4.5 | 140 |\n| | D | 1.2 | 2.8 | 1.8 | 7.0 | 260 |\n| | E | 0.9 | 2.2 | 1.2 | 5.5 | 190 |\n| **3: Dairy** | A | 1.5 | 4.5 | 4.2 | 12.0 | 360 |\n| | B | 1.3 | 4.0 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 310 |\n| | C | 1.7 | 5.0 | 4.8 | 14.0 | 420 |\n| | D | 1.4 | 4.2 | 3.8 | 11.0 | 340 |\n| | E | 1.6 | 4.8 | 4.5 | 13.0 | 400 |\n| **4: Meat** | A | 1.9 | 4.0 | 6.5 | 15.0 | 520 |\n| | B | 1.6 | 3.5 | 5.5 | 13.0 | 460 |\n| | C | 2.1 | 4.5 | 7.2 | 17.0 | 580 |\n| | D | 1.8 | 3.8 | 6.0 | 14.0 | 500 |\n| | E | 2.2 | 4.8 | 7.5 | 18.0 | 600 |\n| **5: Seafood** | A | 1.4 | 3.0 | 8.0 | 16.0 | 480 |\n| | B | 1.2 | 2.8 | 7.0 | 14.0 | 430 |\n| | C | 1.6 | 3.5 | 9.0 | 18.0 | 550 |\n| | D | 1.3 | 2.9 | 7.5 | 15.0 | 450 |\n| | E | 1.7 | 3.8 | 9.5 | 19.0 | 590 |\n| **6: Baked Goods**| A | 0.5 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 2.0 | 90 |\n| | B | 0.7 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 3.0 | 140 |\n| | C | 0.6 | 1.8 | 0.6 | 2.5 | 120 |\n| | D | 0.8 | 2.2 | 1.0 | 3.5 | 160 |\n| | E | 0.4 | 1.2 | 0.4 | 1.5 | 80 |\n| **7: Beverages** | A | 1.8 | 3.0 | 1.5 | 4.0 | 250 |\n| | B | 2.0 | 3.5 | 1.8 | 5.0 | 290 |\n| | C | 1.6 | 2.8 | 1.4 | 3.5 | 220 |\n| | D | 2.2 | 3.8 | 2.0 | 6.0 | 330 |\n| | E | 1.7 | 2.9 | 1.6 | 4.5 | 240 |\n| **8: Frozen** | A | 2.0 | 5.0 | 8.0 | 20.0 | 500 |\n| | B | 1.8 | 4.5 | 7.0 | 18.0 | 450 |\n| | C | 2.3 | 5.5 | 9.0 | 22.0 | 580 |\n| | D | 2.1 | 5.2 | 8.5 | 21.0 | 540 |\n| | E | 2.5 | 6.0 | 9.8 | 24.0 | 620 |\n| **9: Deli Meats** | A | 0.9 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 6.0 | 180 |\n| | B | 1.1 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 7.0 | 240 |\n| | C | 0.8 | 1.8 | 2.8 | 5.5 | 160 |\n| | D | 1.2 | 2.8 | 4.0 | 8.0 | 270 |\n| | E | 1.0 | 2.2 | 3.2 | 6.5 | 210 |\n| **10: Prepared** | A | 1.3 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 9.0 | 300 |\n| | B | 1.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 10.0 | 350 |\n| | C | 1.2 | 2.8 | 3.8 | 8.0 | 280 |\n| | D | 1.6 | 3.8 | 5.0 | 11.0 | 380 |\n| | E | 1.4 | 3.2 | 4.2 | 9.5 | 330 |",

The company has two manufacturing plants (P1 located in City A, P2 located in City B) and is considering opening and operating up to three potential distribution centers (DC1 in Region X, DC2 in Region Y, DC3 in Region Z) to serve four key demand regions (R1, R2, R3, R4). The primary objective is to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon. These costs include: the fixed monthly costs of operating any active DCs, transportation costs for shipping VitaBoost from plants to DCs and from DCs to demand regions, inventory holding costs for products stored at DCs, costs associated with product expiry and disposal, and shortage costs incurred for any unmet demand in the regions.\n\nVitaBoost has a strict shelf life of 2 months. This means that any product manufactured in a given month (say, Month `m`) must be used to satisfy demand by the end of the following month (Month `m+1`). Product not used by this deadline expires and must be disposed of.\n\nAt the beginning of Month 1, DC1 has an initial stock of VitaBoost, provided it is chosen to be operational in Month 1: 10 units that were produced in the immediately preceding month (referred to as 'Month 0' batch, thus being 1-month old at the start of Month 1) and 5 units that were produced two months prior (referred to as 'Month -1' batch, thus being 2-months old at the start of Month 1). This 'Month -1' batch must be used or discarded during Month 1. No other initial inventory exists at other potential DCs or plants.\n\nThe monthly production capacities for the manufacturing plants are as follows (in units, for Months 1 through 6 respectively):\n-   Plant P1: [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270]\n-   Plant P2: [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n\nThe potential distribution centers have associated costs and capacities:\n-   Fixed monthly operating costs if active: DC1: $10,000; DC2: $12,000; DC3: $9,000.\n-   Storage capacities (max units): DC1: 300; DC2: 350; DC3: 280.\n\nTransportation costs per unit of VitaBoost are:\n-   From Plant P1 to DCs: DC1: $5, DC2: $7, DC3: $6.\n-   From Plant P2 to DCs: DC1: $8, DC2: $4, DC3: $7.\n-   From DC1 to Regions: R1: $3, R2: $4, R3: $5, R4: $6.\n-   From DC2 to Regions: R1: $5, R2: $3, R3: $4, R4: $5.\n-   From DC3 to Regions: R1: $4, R2: $5, R3: $3, R4: $4.\n\nOther relevant costs are:\n-   Monthly inventory holding cost per unit at DCs: DC1: $2.0; DC2: $2.5; DC3: $1.8.\n-   Disposal cost for expired product: $1 per unit at any DC.\n-   Shortage cost for unmet demand: $50 per unit, uniform across all regions and months.\n\nThe forecasted monthly demand for VitaBoost (in units) for each region over the 6-month horizon is:\n-   Region R1: [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]\n-   Region R2: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105]\n-   Region R3: [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145]\n-   Region R4: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n\nPharmaLogistics Inc. needs to determine an optimal plan that specifies: which DCs to operate in each month, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network. This plan must ensure that demand is met as effectively as possible while respecting the product's shelf life and minimizing total costs.",

    "description": "An urban shared e-bike company, \"E-Donkey Express,\" needs to create a nightly battery-swapping plan for its fleet, which is distributed across three zones using its two mobile maintenance vans. The company's objective is to minimize the total nightly cost, which consists of a fixed dispatch fee for each van used and a variable operational cost. This operational cost is uniquely challenging, as it is proportional to the square of the number of batteries replaced by a van in a given zone (Cost = Coefficient × N²), reflecting a diseconomy of scale due to on-site logistical complexities.\nThe plan must ensure that all e-bikes with low-power batteries are serviced, while also respecting the maximum number of new batteries each van can carry. The core decision is how to assign the battery-swapping workload—which zones each van should service, and how many batteries to replace in each—to meet all demands at the lowest possible total cost. All necessary operational data is provided below.\n\nTable 1: Zonal Demand Data\n\n| Zone | Total E-Bikes | Low Battery Percentage (%) |\n|:----:|:--------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|   A  |      200       |             60             |\n|   B  |      150       |             80             |\n|   C  |      180       |             50             |\n\nTable 2: Maintenance Station Parameters\n\n| Parameter                    | Van 1 | Van 2 |\n|:-----------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|\n| Dispatch Cost ($)            |  300  |  320  |\n| Max Battery Capacity (units) |  150  |  180  |\n| Operational Cost Coefficient | 0.08  | 0.07  |",

    "description": "A shared mobility company plans to deploy a fleet of 1,000 electric scooters across five key hotspot zones in a city. To ensure service stability and a positive user experience, the company aims to achieve a balanced deployment that aligns with the demand profile of each zone.\n\nThe company's goal is to minimize the network's imbalance. This imbalance is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the number of scooters deployed in each zone and an ideal, attractiveness-weighted deployment. The ideal deployment for a zone is calculated by distributing the total fleet proportionally to that zone's share of the total attractiveness.\n\nWhen planning the deployment, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The total number of scooters deployed across all zones must equal 1,000.\n2. To align operational capacity with potential demand, the number of scooters in each zone must not be less than a minimum quota. This quota is set at 10% of the total fleet size, weighted by the proportion of that zone's attractiveness relative to the total attractiveness of all zones.\n3. The 'Commercial Center' and 'Transit Hub' zones are geographically adjacent and frequently interact with each other. To ensure service continuity, the absolute difference in the number of scooters deployed in these two zones must not exceed 50.\n4. The company has divided the zones into two operational clusters: Cluster 1 (Commercial Center, Tourist Area) and Cluster 2 (University City, Tech Park, Transit Hub). Each cluster can deploy a maximum of 600 scooters to match the management capacity of local operational teams.\n\nThe attractiveness data for each zone is provided in the table below. Please devise a deployment plan that minimizes the network imbalance while satisfying all constraints.\n\nTable: Zonal Attractiveness Data\n\n| Hotspot Zone | Attractiveness (Predicted Daily Trips) |\n|:---|:---|\n| Commercial Center | 500 |\n| University City | 800 |\n| Tech Park | 700 |\n| Tourist Area | 600 |\n| Transit Hub | 900 |",
