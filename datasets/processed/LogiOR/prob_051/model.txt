Set:
1. Tasks
The set of all tasks, \( T = \{1, 2, ..., 10\} \)
2. Workstations
The set of potential workstations, \( W = \{1, 2, ..., 7\} \) (upper bound estimated)

Parameter:
1. TaskDuration
Duration of each task \( t \), \( d_t \): [36, 36, 30, 30, 24, 30, 24, 12, 54, 12]
2. CycleTime
Maximum allowed time per workstation, \( C = 66 \)
3. Precedence
Set of direct precedence pairs \( (i,j) \) where task \( i \) must precede task \( j \): 
{(1,2), (1,5), (2,7), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,8), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10)}
4. StationInterval
For each task \( t \), the range of possible workstations \( I_t \) it can be assigned to, calculated based on earliest and latest possible stations considering precedence and cycle time

Decision variable:
1. TaskAssignment
Binary variable \( x_{tw} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( t \in T, w \in W \), where \( x_{tw} = 1 \) if task \( t \) is assigned to workstation \( w \), and 0 otherwise
2. StationUsed
Binary variable \( y_w \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( w \in W \), where \( y_w = 1 \) if workstation \( w \) is used, and 0 otherwise

Objective:
Minimize the number of workstations used
min: \(\sum_{w \in W} y_w\)

Constraint:
1. Each task must be assigned to exactly one workstation within its feasible interval
\(\sum_{w \in I_t} x_{tw} = 1, \forall t \in T\)
2. The total duration of tasks assigned to each workstation cannot exceed cycle time
\(\sum_{t \in T} d_t \cdot x_{tw} \leq C \cdot y_w, \forall w \in W\)
3. Workstations must be used in sequence (if station w+1 is used, station w must be used)
\(y_{w+1} \leq y_w, \forall w \in \{1,...,6\}\)
4. Precedence relationships must be maintained
\(\sum_{w \in W} w \cdot x_{iw} \leq \sum_{w \in W} w \cdot x_{jw}, \forall (i,j) \in Precedence\)
