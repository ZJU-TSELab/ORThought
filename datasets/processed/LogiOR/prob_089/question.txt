A courier company needs to plan an optimal single-delivery route for one of its couriers. The route starts at a central depot, serves 10 customers, and then returns to the depot. The courier's travel speed is constant at 30 km/h, and the travel cost is ¥5 per kilometer.
Each customer has a desired "service time window." If the courier's actual arrival time deviates from the center of the customer's desired time window, the company incurs a "customer satisfaction penalty" cost. This cost is proportional to the square of the time deviation, calculated by the formula: $Cost = 0.2 \times (\text{Actual Arrival Time} - \text{Time Window Center})^2$.
The company's objective is to determine a unique customer visit sequence and calculate a precise arrival time for each customer to minimize the cost. The courier departs at 8:30 AM from the depot, located at coordinates (0,0). All relevant data are listed in the table below.
