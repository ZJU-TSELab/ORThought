Set:
1. Gates
The set of gates available at the airport, \( G = \{1, 2\} \)
2. Flights
The set of flights to be assigned to the gates, \( F = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)

Parameter:
1. ArrangeStartTime
[600, 630, 645, 675]
2. Duration
[60, 60, 75, 60]
3. CostPerDelyTime
1
4. M: A large positive number
1500

Decision variable:
1. Assignment
Binary variable \( x_{fg} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( f \in F, g \in G \), where \( x_{fg} = 1 \) if flight \( f \) is assigned to gate \( g \), and \( x_{fg} = 0 \) otherwise.
2. ActualStartTime
Integer variable \( s_f \) representing the actual start time of flight \( f \in F\)

Objective:
The total cost of flight delays
min: \sum_{f\in F}\sum_{g\in G}CostPerDelyTime\cdot (s_f-ArrangeStartTime_f)\cdot x_{fg}

Constraint:
1. Actual start time should be greater than or equal to the scheduled start time.
s_f \geq ArrangeStartTime_f, \forall f \in F

2. Every flight should be assigned to exactly one gate.
\sum_{g\in G}x_{fg} = 1, \forall f \in F

3. The actual start time should be greater than or equal to the end time of the previous flight at the same gate.
s_{f2} \geq s_{f1}+Duration_{f1} - M*(2-x[f1, g]-x[f2, g]), \forall f1, f2 \in F, f1 < f2, x_{f1g} = 1, x_{f2g} = 1 \forall g \in G
