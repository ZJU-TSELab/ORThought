An airport has two available gates (G1, G2) and needs to assign four flights (F1: 10:00-11:00, F2: 10:30-11:30, F3: 11:15-12:30, F4: 10:45-11:45) to these gates. Flights assigned to the same gate must have non-overlapping time intervals, and the goal is to minimize flight delays, where each 1-minute delay beyond the scheduled departure time incurs a cost of 1 unit. How should the flights be assigned to the gates to achieve this objective?
