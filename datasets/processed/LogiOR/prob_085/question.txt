You are the manager of a large cross-docking center responsible for assigning docks for the next hour's operations, which involves 4 arriving shipments and 3 departing shipments. The center has 4 inbound docks (I1, I2, I3, I4) and 3 outbound docks (O1, O2, O3), distributed across two different operational zones. The docks in Zone A include I1, I2, and O1, while Zone B includes I3, I4, O2, and O3. The efficiency of forklift operations within a zone decreases with congestion, which is modeled as a cost function that is quadratic in the total number of items passing through that zone. The congestion cost coefficient is 0.00005 for Zone A and 0.00004 for Zone B. Decision-makers need to assign a unique dock to each shipment to minimize the total internal handling cost, which is composed of a base handling cost and a zonal congestion cost. The base handling cost is ¥0.1 per item. The arriving shipments consist of four suppliers: S1 with 200 items, S2 with 150 items, S3 with 180 items, and S4 with 220 items. The departing shipments consist of three retailers: R1 with 250 items, R2 with 300 items, and R3 with 200 items. How should the center assign each shipment to a unique dock to minimize the total internal handling cost?
