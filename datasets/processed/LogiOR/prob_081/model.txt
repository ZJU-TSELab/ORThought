Set:
1. Route 
The set of available transportation routes, \( R = \{1, 2, 3\} \)

Parameter:
1. TotalTonnage
# The total amount of goods to be shipped
100 
2. LinearCostPerTon 
# The base transportation cost per ton for each route, excluding congestion fees. This is calculated by summing the costs of all segments for a given route (`distance * base_fee`).  
[700, 1085, 670] # in dollars per ton for Route 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
3. CongestionCoeff 
# The coefficient for calculating the congestion fee on applicable routes.  
[5e-7, 8e-7, 0] # Route 3 has no congestion fee.
4. BackgroundTraffic 
# The existing traffic volume on congested routes.  
[2000, 1500, 0] # in tons. Route 3 has no congested segment.

Decision variable:
1. TonnageOnRoute 
Continuous variable, \( TonnageOnRoute[r] \forall r \in R \), representing the amount of goods in tons transported via route \( r \).

Objective:
1. Minimize the total transportation cost. The objective is to minimize the sum of the linear transportation costs and the non-linear congestion fees for all routes.  
min: \( \sum_{r \in R} (LinearCostPerTon[r] \times TonnageOnRoute[r] + CongestionCoeff[r] \times (BackgroundTraffic[r] + TonnageOnRoute[r])^2) \)

Constraint:
1. Total Shipment Constraint. The sum of goods transported on all routes must equal the total tonnage required to be shipped.  
\( \sum_{r \in R} TonnageOnRoute[r] = TotalTonnage \)
2. Non-negativity constraint. The amount of goods transported on any route cannot be negative.  
\( TonnageOnRoute[r] \geq 0 \forall r \in R \)

Type:
Continuous, Non-linear, Linear
