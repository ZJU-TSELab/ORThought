A regional beverage distributor needs to design an optimal delivery network from their central warehouse (node 0) to 8 retail stores (nodes 1-8). The road network between locations has the following distances (in km): [(0,1)=12, (0,2)=8, (1,2)=5, (1,3)=9, (2,4)=7, (3,4)=6, (3,5)=11, (4,6)=10, (5,6)=4, (5,7)=8, (6,8)=7, (7,8)=6]. Each delivery truck has a capacity of serving maximum 3 stores (including transfers). The company wants to minimize total travel distance while ensuring no truck serves more than 3 nodes in its subtree. The warehouse must be connected to all stores through a single network without cycles.
