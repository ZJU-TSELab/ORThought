A regional distribution center needs to create a delivery schedule for 4 customer orders using 3 available trucks. Each customer order is a "job" that consists of 3 separate "packages" or "operations," one for each truck. The time required to process each package on its designated truck is known.

The center wants to determine the start time for every single package to minimize the **makespan**, which is the total time elapsed until the very last package across all trucks is delivered.

The scheduling must adhere to two critical constraints:
1.  **Truck Constraint:** Each truck can only process one package at a time.
2.  **Customer Constraint:** For a single customer, their different packages (on different trucks) cannot be processed simultaneously.

The processing times (in hours) are as follows:
| Customer / Job | Package for T1 | Package for T2 | Package for T3 |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| C1             | 2              | 3              | 1              |
| C2             | 4              | 2              | 3              |
| C3             | 1              | 5              | 2              |
| C4             | 3              | 2              | 4              |
