A garbage dump needs to dispatch garbage trucks to fixed locations to collect garbage every day. The coordinates of the garbage dump are (0, 0), and it owns 4 garbage trucks, each with a capacity limit of 100 and a maximum driving distance of 45. There are 15 garbage collection points in total, with coordinates (3, -8), (-10, -5), (3, 0), (-3, -3), (5, -1), (-7, 3), (5, -3), (4, -5), (6, 4), (3, 1), (-10, 0), (-2, 7), (-6, -3), (-8, -7), (-1, 8), and garbage amounts of 20, 20, 28, 12, 30, 24, 30, 12, 27, 26, 21, 20, 12, 16, 19, respectively. Every garbage trucks need to start from the garbage dump, collect garbage from all collection points on the planned route, and return to the garbage dump. What is the shortest total driving distance for all garbage trucks? (Assume the distance between points is calculated as the straight-line distance.)
