Mathematical Model:
Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{A, B, C, D, E\} \)
2. Stores
The set of stores, \( S = \{Store1, Store2, Store3\} \)
3. Trucks
The set of trucks, \( T = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProductWeights
[2, 3, 1, 4, 2] (tons) for products A to E respectively
2. StoreDemands
- Store1: [2, 1, 3, 0, 0] (units of A-E)
- Store2: [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] 
- Store3: [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]
3. TruckCapacity
15 (tons)

Decision variable:
1. ProductDelivery
Integer variable \( x_{pst} \geq 0 \) for all \( p \in P, s \in S, t \in T \), representing quantity of product p delivered to store s using truck t
2. TruckUsed
Binary variable \( y_t \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( t \in T \), where \( y_t = 1 \) if truck t is used

Objective:
Minimize total trucks used
min: \sum_{t\in T}y_t

Constraint:
1. Meet all store demands
\sum_{t\in T}x_{pst} = StoreDemands_{sp}, \forall p \in P, s \in S
2. Truck capacity limit
\sum_{p\in P}\sum_{s\in S}ProductWeights_p \cdot x_{pst} \leq TruckCapacity \cdot y_t, \forall t \in T
3. Logical constraint (if any product is delivered by truck t, it must be marked as used)
x_{pst} \leq M \cdot y_t, \forall p \in P, s \in S, t \in T (where M is a large enough constant)
