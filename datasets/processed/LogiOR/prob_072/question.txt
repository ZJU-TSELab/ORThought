A warehouse needs to distribute 5 types of products (A, B, C, D, E) to 3 retail stores (Store1, Store2, Store3) using delivery trucks. Each truck has a maximum capacity of 15 tons. The products have the following weights per unit: A=2 tons, B=3 tons, C=1 ton, D=4 tons, E=2 tons. The stores require the following quantities: Store1 needs 2A+1B+3C, Store2 needs 1A+2D+1E, Store3 needs 3B+2C+1E. The warehouse has 4 trucks available. The goal is to minimize the total number of trucks used while meeting all store demands without exceeding truck capacities.
