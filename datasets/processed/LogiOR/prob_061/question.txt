A regional logistics company needs to optimize its cargo transportation network involving 3 supply points (S1, S2, S3), 2 transshipment hubs (H1, H2), and 4 demand points (D1, D2, D3, D4). The supply capacities are 200, 150, and 180 units respectively. Demand requirements are 120, 90, 110, and 130 units respectively. Transportation costs (per unit) between nodes are: S1-H1=5, S1-H2=7, S2-H1=6, S2-H2=8, S3-H1=4, S3-H2=5, H1-D1=3, H1-D2=4, H1-D3=5, H1-D4=6, H2-D1=4, H2-D2=3, H2-D3=6, H2-D4=5. All routes have unlimited capacity. The objective is to minimize total transportation costs while meeting all supply and demand constraints.
