A logistics company needs to pack 12 rectangular parcels into a shipping container with fixed width of 100 cm and variable height. The parcels have different dimensions and must be placed orthogonally (no rotations allowed). The goal is to arrange all parcels within the container while minimizing the total height used. The parcels have the following dimensions (width × height in cm):
1. 30×40, 2. 25×35, 3. 40×20, 4. 15×25, 5. 35×30, 6. 20×15, 7. 25×20, 8. 30×25, 9. 15×10, 10. 20×30, 11. 10×15, 12. 25×10. Parcels cannot overlap and must be completely contained within the container's width. The container has unlimited height capacity, but the objective is to minimize the used height.
