Set:
1.  Vessel 
The set of available vessels, \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \) # 1: Ship A, 2: Ship B, 3: Ship C

Parameter:
1.  Distance
The total sailing distance.  
    6000 # in nautical miles
2.  MaxTime
The maximum allowed time for the voyage.  
    288 # in hours
3.  FuelPrice
The cost of fuel.  
    4000 # in ¥ per ton
4.  CarbonTax
The tax on CO2 emissions.  
    300 # in ¥ per ton of CO2
5.  FuelCoeffs
The coefficients \([a, b, c]\) for the fuel consumption formula \(a \times v^2 + b \times v + c\).  
    [[0.005, 0.1, 1.2], [0.004, 0.08, 1.5], [0.006, 0.12, 1.0]]
6.  CO2Factor
The CO2 emission factor for each vessel.  
    [3.2, 3.15, 3.25] # in tons of CO2 per ton of fuel
7.  FixedCost
The fixed cost for selecting each vessel.  
    [500000, 600000, 450000] # in ¥

Decision variable:
1.  SelectVessel
Binary variable, \( y[s] \forall s \in S \), which is 1 if vessel \(s\) is selected, and 0 otherwise.
2.  SailingSpeed
Continuous variable, \( v \), representing the sailing speed in knots.

Objective:
1.  Minimize the total cost.
The objective is to minimize the sum of the selected vessel's fixed cost, fuel cost, and carbon cost. The fuel and carbon costs are functions of the sailing speed \( v \).  
    min: \( \sum_{s \in S} y[s] \times \bigg( FixedCost[s] + (FuelPrice + CarbonTax \times CO2Factor[s]) \times Distance \times (FuelCoeffs[s][0] \times v + FuelCoeffs[s][1] + \frac{FuelCoeffs[s][2]}{v}) \bigg) \)

Constraint:
1. Vessel Selection Constraint
Exactly one vessel must be selected for the mission.  
    \( \sum_{s \in S} y[s] = 1 \)
2. Time Constraint
The total voyage time must not exceed the maximum allowed time. This imposes a minimum required speed.  
    \( v \geq \frac{Distance}{MaxTime} \)
3. Variable Type Constraints
\( y[s] \in \{0, 1\} \forall s \in S \)  
    \( v > 0 \)

Type:
Mixed, Non-linear, Linear
