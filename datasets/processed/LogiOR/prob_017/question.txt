The Health Bureau of a city, in order to strengthen primary healthcare services, has equipped a mobile medical vehicle to regularly provide basic medical check-ups and medicines to various communities in the suburbs. To improve service efficiency, it is necessary to optimize the route of the mobile medical vehicle. The starting point of the medical vehicle is the Central City Hospital, located at coordinates (0, 0). The location information of the 10 communities to be served is as follows:

| COMMUNITY ID | (x, y)      |
|--------------|-------------|
| C1           | (3.5, 4.2)  |
| C2           | (-2.1, 5.6) |
| C3           | (4.8, -3.2) |
| C4           | (-3.6, -2.8)|
| C5           | (5.2, 2.4)  |
| C6           | (-4.1, 3.7) |
| C7           | (2.8, -4.5) |
| C8           | (6.3, -2.1) |
| C9           | (-5.2, -1.8)|
| C10          | (3.9, 5.8)  |
