A city plans to establish a low-altitude drone delivery network covering a 100×100 area (with both horizontal and vertical coordinates ranging from [0, 100]). There are 8 demand points within this area, with coordinates at (10, 20), (25, 60), (40, 80), (65, 50), (80, 20), (15, 45), (70, 75), and (90, 90). The goal is to select 2 drone logistics hubs at arbitrary locations within the area. What is the minimum possible value of the maximum Euclidean distance from all demand points to their nearest drone logistics hub?
