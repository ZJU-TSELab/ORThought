Set:
1. Containers
The set of container types, \( C = \{1, 2, ..., 7\} \)

Parameter:
1. Volume
The volume of each container type (in liters):
[17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 29, 33]

2. Demand
The demand for each container type (in units):
[500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100]

3. VariableCost
The variable cost of producing each container type (equals its volume in dollars):
[17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 29, 33]

4. FixedCost
The fixed cost of producing any container type:
1000

Decision variable:
1. Produce
Binary variable, \( Produce_j \forall j \in C \), where \( Produce_j = 1 \) if container type j is produced, 0 otherwise.

2. Assign
Integer variable, \( Assign_{i,j} \forall i,j \in C, i \leq j \), where \( Assign_{i,j} \) is the number of demand for container type i satisfied by container type j.

Objective:
1. Minimize the total cost of production.
min: \sum_{j \in C} (FixedCost * Produce_j + VariableCost[j] * \sum_{i \in C, i \leq j} Assign_{i,j})

Constraint:
1. Demand satisfaction constraint.
\sum_{j \in C, j \geq i} Assign_{i,j} = Demand[i] \forall i \in C

2. Production activation constraint.
\sum_{i \in C, i \leq j} Assign_{i,j} \leq M * Produce_j \forall j \in C
(where M is a sufficiently large number, such as the sum of all demands)

Type:
Mixed-integer, Linear, Linear
MIP
