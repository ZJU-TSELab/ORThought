Set:
1. Suppliers 
The set of Suppliers, \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \)
2. Warehouses
The set of Warehouses, \( W = \{1, 2\} \)
3. Customers
The set of Customers, \( C = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)

Parameter:
1. SupplierCapacities
[120, 150, 90] units for S1, S2, S3 respectively
2. CustomerDemands
[80, 60, 70, 90] units for C1 to C4 respectively
3. DirectCost
Matrix d where d[s,c] is direct shipping cost from supplier s to customer c:
d = [[8,10,12,14], [9,7,11,13], [11,9,8,10]]
4. FirstLegCost
Matrix f where f[s,w] is cost from supplier s to warehouse w:
f = [[4,5], [6,3], [5,4]]
5. SecondLegCost
Matrix l where l[w,c] is cost from warehouse w to customer c:
l = [[6,5,7,9], [7,6,5,8]]
6. HandlingCost
2 per unit at any warehouse
7. WarehouseCapacity
[200, 180] units for W1 and W2 respectively

Decision variable:
1. DirectShip
Continuous variable \( x_{sc} \geq 0 \) for all \( s \in S, c \in C \), units shipped directly from supplier s to customer c
2. CrossDockFirst
Continuous variable \( y_{sw} \geq 0 \) for all \( s \in S, w \in W \), units shipped from supplier s to warehouse w
3. CrossDockSecond
Continuous variable \( z_{wc} \geq 0 \) for all \( w \in W, c \in C \), units shipped from warehouse w to customer c

Objective:
Minimize total logistics cost including transportation and handling:
min: 
\( \sum_{s\in S}\sum_{c\in C} d[s][c] \cdot x_{sc} \) (direct shipping) 
\( + \sum_{s\in S}\sum_{w\in W} f[s][w] \cdot y_{sw} \) (first leg) 
\( + \sum_{w\in W}\sum_{c\in C} l[w][c] \cdot z_{wc} \) (second leg)
\( + 2 \cdot \sum_{w\in W}\sum_{c\in C} z_{wc} \) (handling)

Constraint:
1. Supplier capacity not exceeded
\( \sum_{c\in C}x_{sc} + \sum_{w\in W}y_{sw} \leq SupplierCapacities_s, \forall s \in S \)
2. Customer demand satisfied
\( \sum_{s\in S}x_{sc} + \sum_{w\in W}z_{wc} = CustomerDemands_c, \forall c \in C \)
3. Warehouse flow balance
\( \sum_{s\in S}y_{sw} = \sum_{c\in C}z_{wc}, \forall w \in W \)
4. Warehouse capacity limit
\( \sum_{s\in S}y_{sw} \leq WarehouseCapacity_w, \forall w \in W \)
