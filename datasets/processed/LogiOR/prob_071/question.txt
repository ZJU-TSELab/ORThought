A logistics company manages shipments between 3 suppliers (S1, S2, S3), 2 cross-docking warehouses (W1, W2), and 4 customers (C1, C2, C3, C4). The suppliers have weekly capacities of [120, 150, 90] units respectively. Customers demand [80, 60, 70, 90] units weekly. 

Transport costs per unit:
- Direct shipping: S1→[C1,C2,C3,C4] costs [8,10,12,14], S2→[C1,C2,C3,C4] costs [9,7,11,13], S3→[C1,C2,C3,C4] costs [11,9,8,10]
- Cross-docking first leg: S1→[W1,W2] costs [4,5], S2→[W1,W2] costs [6,3], S3→[W1,W2] costs [5,4]
- Cross-docking second leg: W1→[C1,C2,C3,C4] costs [6,5,7,9], W2→[C1,C2,C3,C4] costs [7,6,5,8]
Cross-docking handling cost is $2/unit at each warehouse. Maximum throughput at W1 is 200 units, W2 is 180 units. 

The company wants to minimize total logistics costs while meeting all customer demands without exceeding supplier capacities and warehouse throughput limits.
