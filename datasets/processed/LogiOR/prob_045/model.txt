Set:
1. Packaging
The set of packaging types, \( P = \{1, 2\} \)  # 1: Premium, 2: Standard
2. Method
The set of production methods, \( M = \{1, 2, 3\} \)  
3. YieldQuality
The set of quality scores, \( Q = \{1, 2, 3\} \) # 1: Quality 6, 2: Quality 8, 3: Quality 10

Parameter:
1. CostPerTonPerMethod
[4.20, 3.80, 4.50]  # in dollars
2. YieldPerMethod
[[0.3, 0.4, 0.3], [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]]  # yield of quality scores per method
3. UpgradeCost
[1.20, 1.80]  # cost to upgrade quality scores 6 to 8 and 8 to 10 in dollars
4. PricePerTon
[15, 8]  # price per ton for Premium and Standard packaging in dollars
5. MinQualityScore
[9, 7]  # minimum quality score for Premium and Standard packaging
6. MaxDemand
[2500, 800]  # maximum demand for Premium and Standard packaging in tons

Decision variable:
1. ProcessingAmount
Continuous variable, \( ProcessingAmount[m] \forall m \in M \), the amount of recycled paper processed using method \( m \) in tons.
2. Quality6UpgradeAmount
Continuous variable, \( Quality6UpgradeAmount \), the amount of quality score 6 upgraded to quality score 8 in tons.
3. Quality8UpgradeAmount
Continuous variable, \( Quality8UpgradeAmount \), the amount of quality score 8 upgraded to quality score 10 in tons.
4. PackagingProducedPerQuality
Continuous variable, \( PackagingProduced[p][q] \forall p \in P, q \in Q \), the amount of packaging produced of type \( p \) with quality score \( q \) in tons.

Objective:
1. Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P, q \in Q} (PricePerTon[p] * PackagingProduced[p][q]) - \sum_{m \in M} (CostPerTonPerMethod[m] * ProcessingAmount[m]) - UpgradeCost[0] * Quality6UpgradeAmount - UpgradeCost[1] * Quality8UpgradeAmount

Constraint:
1. Quality score constraint for packaging.
\sum_{q \in Q} (q * PackagingProduced[p][q]) \geq MinQualityScore[p] * \sum_{q \in Q} PackagingProduced[p][q] \forall p \in P
2. Demand constraint for packaging.
\sum_{q \in Q} PackagingProduced[p][q] \leq MaxDemand[p] \forall p \in P
3. Yield constraint for quality scores.
\sum_{m \in M} (YieldPerMethod[m][0] * ProcessingAmount[m]) - Quality6UpgradeAmount \geq \sum_{p \in P} PackagingProduced[p][1] \quad \text{(Quality 6)}
\sum_{m \in M} (YieldPerMethod[m][1] * ProcessingAmount[m]) + Quality6UpgradeAmount - Quality8UpgradeAmount \geq \sum_{p \in P} PackagingProduced[p][2] \quad \text{(Quality 8)}
\sum_{m \in M} (YieldPerMethod[m][2] * ProcessingAmount[m]) + Quality8UpgradeAmount \geq \sum_{p \in P} PackagingProduced[p][3] \quad \text{(Quality 10)}
4. Non-negativity constraint.
ProcessingAmount[m] \geq 0 \forall m \in M
PackagingProduced[p][q] \geq 0 \forall p \in P, q \in Q
Quality6UpgradeAmount \geq 0
Quality8UpgradeAmount \geq 0
