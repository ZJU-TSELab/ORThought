Green Energy Solutions specializes in producing two types of renewable fuel: bioethanol and biodiesel. The company has 8,000 liters of feedstock A and 12,000 liters of feedstock B in stock. The quality rating of each feedstock is as follows: feedstock A—12; feedstock B—6. Bioethanol must have an average quality rating of at least 10, while biodiesel must have an average quality rating of at least 8. The demand for each product is driven by marketing efforts. Each dollar spent on marketing bioethanol generates 8 liters of demand, and each dollar spent on marketing biodiesel generates 15 liters of demand. Bioethanol is sold for $30 per liter, and biodiesel is sold for $25 per liter. Help Green Energy Solutions maximize its profit. Assume that the company cannot purchase additional feedstock of either type.
