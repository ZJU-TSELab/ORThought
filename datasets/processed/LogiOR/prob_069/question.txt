A regional water distribution company needs to optimize its pipeline network to maximize the daily water supply from Reservoir A (source) to City D (sink). The network consists of 5 pumping stations (nodes B, C, E, F, G) connected by pipelines with the following capacities (in thousand cubic meters/day): A→B (15), A→C (10), B→C (5), B→D (10), C→E (8), C→F (12), E→D (7), F→D (20), G→D (0, currently inactive). Pumping station G is temporarily out of service. The system must maintain flow conservation at all intermediate nodes while respecting pipeline capacities.
