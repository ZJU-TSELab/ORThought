A publishing company needs to plan the optimal strategy for printing books over the next six months. The company has forecasted the monthly demand as follows: Month 1—5,000 copies; Month 2—6,000 copies; Month 3—5,500 copies; Month 4—7,000 copies; Month 5—4,500 copies; Month 6—4,000 copies. The cost of printing one copy is $2 during regular working hours (RT) and $3 during overtime (OT). Each month, regular-time production is limited to 6,000 copies, and overtime production is limited to 2,000 copies. Additionally, the inventory holding cost is $0.5 per copy per month. What is the minimum total cost to meet the demand for the next six months on time?
