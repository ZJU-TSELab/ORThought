A container terminal needs to allocate berths (which are arranged in a straight line with a total length of 900) for 9 vessels (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) arriving within 4 days. The lengths of the vessels are 287, 196, 261, 288, 208, 238, 190, 217 and 254 respectively. The arrival times of the vessels are 9, 27, 34, 40, 1, 31, 28, 20, and 22 hours respectively, while the required working times for loading and unloading after docking are 7, 31, 31, 25, 29, 11, 28, 24, and 20 hours respectively. The optimal berthing positions for the vessels are 375, 419, 591, 510, 567, 64, 507, 377, and 93 respectively. A berthing plan now needs to be devised, where the additional operational costs caused by deviations from the original optimal berthing positions are 8, 4, 5, 5, 2, 6, 8, 6, and 8 per unit of distance, and the delay costs are 7, 7, 3, 4, 4, 7, 2, 4, and 7 per hour of delay. What is the minimum total additional cost resulting from deviations from the optimal berthing positions and delays? (Assume vessels can only dock at integer positions on the hour.)
