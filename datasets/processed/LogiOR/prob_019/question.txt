A fresh food e-commerce platform has one distribution center in the city and needs to use a fleet of refrigerated trucks to deliver fresh products to 12 supermarkets. Each supermarket has a specified time window for receiving goods and a specified unloading time. The distribution center has 5 identical refrigerated trucks, each with a maximum load of 3 tons and a speed of 40 km/h. The coordinates of the distribution center are (0, 0), and the information of the supermarkets is as follows:
