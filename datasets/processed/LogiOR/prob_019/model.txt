Decision variable:
1. X
Binary variable, \( x_{ijk} \forall i \in N, j \in N, k \in K\), where \( x_{ijk} = 1 \) if truck \( k \) departs from node \( i \) and arrives at node \( j \), otherwise \( x_{ijk} = 0 \).
2. T^a
Continous variable, \( t^a_i \forall i \in N\), where \( t^a_i \) is the time at which the truck arrives at node \( i \).
3. T^d
Continous variable, \( t^d_i \forall i \in N\), where \( t^d_i \) is the time at which the truck departs from node \( i \).

Objective:
1. Minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks.
min: \sum_{k \in K}\sum_{i \in N} \sum_{j \in N} Distance[i][j] * x_{ijk}
# Where \( Distance[i][j] \) is the Euclidean distance between node \( i \) and node \( j \).

Constraint:
1. Each supermarket must be visited exactly once by one truck.
\sum_{k \in K} \sum_{i \in N} x_{ijk} = 1 \forall j \in N/{0}
2. Each supermarket must be exited exactly once by one truck.
\sum_{k \in K} \sum_{j \in N} x_{ijk} = 1 \forall i \in N/{0}
3. Each truck must leave the distribution center once.
\sum_{j \in N} x_{0jk} = 1 \forall k \in K
4. Each truck must return to the distribution center once.
\sum_{i \in N} x_{i0k} = 1 \forall k \in K
5. Eliminate sub-tours.
\sum_{i \in N} \sum_{j \in N} x_{ijk} \leq |S| - 1 \forall S \subseteq N, 1 < |S| < |N|, k \in K
6. The truck must arrive at each supermarket within its time window.
t^a_i \geq Timewindow[i][0] \forall i \in N/{0}
7. The truck must depart from each supermarket within its time window.
t^d_i \leq Timewindow[i][1] \forall i \in N/{0}
8. The truck's arrival time at each node must be more than or equal to the departure time from the previous node plus the travel time between the two nodes.
t^d_i + \frac{Distance[i][j]}{Speed} - M * (1 - x_{ijk}) \leq t^a_j \forall i, j \in N, k \in K
t^d_i + \frac{Distance[i][j]}{Speed} + M * (1 - x_{ijk}) \geq t^a_j \forall i, j \in N, k \in K
