Set:
1. CustomerZones
The set of customer zones, \( C = \{C1, C2, C3, C4, C5\} \)
2. WarehouseLocations
The set of potential warehouse locations, \( W = \{W1, W2, W3\} \)

Parameter:
1. DistanceMatrix
The distance between warehouse location \( w \in W \) and customer zone \( c \in C \), denoted as \( d_{wc} \)
Values: 
d(W1,C1)=10, d(W1,C2)=15, ..., d(W3,C5)=12 (from the distance matrix above)
2. p
The number of warehouses to be opened, p=2

Decision variable:
1. WarehouseOpen
Binary variable \( y_w \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( w \in W \), where \( y_w = 1 \) if warehouse \( w \) is opened, and \( y_w = 0 \) otherwise
2. Assignment
Binary variable \( x_{wc} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( w \in W, c \in C \), where \( x_{wc} = 1 \) if customer zone \( c \) is assigned to warehouse \( w \), and \( x_{wc} = 0 \) otherwise

Objective:
Minimize the total distance between each customer zone and its assigned warehouse
min: \( \sum_{w \in W} \sum_{c \in C} d_{wc} \cdot x_{wc} \)

Constraint:
1. Exactly p warehouses must be opened
\( \sum_{w \in W} y_w = p \)
2. Each customer zone must be assigned to exactly one warehouse
\( \sum_{w \in W} x_{wc} = 1, \forall c \in C \)
3. A customer zone can only be assigned to an opened warehouse
\( x_{wc} \leq y_w, \forall w \in W, \forall c \in C \)
