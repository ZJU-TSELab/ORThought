A regional grocery chain is launching a new energy drink product and needs to optimally allocate initial stock to its stores. There are 6 stores (S1-S6) with varying characteristics. Each store has a known customer traffic (daily visits: S1-1200, S2-800, S3-1500, S4-900, S5-1100, S6-700), shelf space allocation (units: S1-50, S2-30, S3-60, S4-35, S5-45, S6-25), and historical sales similarity score for similar products (0-1 scale: S1-0.8, S2-0.6, S3-0.9, S4-0.7, S5-0.75, S6-0.5). The warehouse has 300 units available for initial distribution. There are two types of display setups: standard (costs $5 per store) and promotional (costs $15 per store but increases effective shelf space by 20%). The total display budget is $120. The goal is to maximize expected product exposure, calculated as: (customer traffic) × (units allocated) × (sales similarity score).
