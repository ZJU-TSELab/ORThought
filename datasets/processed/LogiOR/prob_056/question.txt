A bus company needs to schedule departures for a specific route during the morning peak hours (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) to minimize the total passenger waiting time. Each bus has a minimum departure interval of 5 minutes and a maximum departure interval of 10 minutes, with a round-trip time of 30 minutes including stops. The company has a maximum of 5 buses available for scheduling. Passengers arrive at the station uniformly at a constant rate during the morning rush hour. The objective is to determine the optimal departure schedule by formulating an integer programming model that minimizes the total passenger waiting time while satisfying the given constraints.
