A regional distribution center needs to optimize its daily delivery routes for 5 stores located at different distances. The center has 3 available delivery trucks with capacities of 8, 10, and 12 tons respectively. The daily demands of the stores are: Store1 (3 tons), Store2 (4 tons), Store3 (5 tons), Store4 (2 tons), and Store5 (6 tons). The distance matrix (in km) between the distribution center (DC) and stores is: DC-Store1: 15, DC-Store2: 20, DC-Store3: 25, DC-Store4: 30, DC-Store5: 35. Each truck can visit multiple stores but cannot exceed its capacity. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all trucks while ensuring all store demands are met.
