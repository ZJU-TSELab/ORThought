Set:
1. Trucks
The set of available trucks, \( T = \{1, 2, 3\} \)
2. Stores
The set of stores to be served, \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)

Parameter:
1. TruckCapacities
[8, 10, 12]  # Capacity of each truck in tons
2. StoreDemands
[3, 4, 5, 2, 6]  # Demand of each store in tons
3. Distances
[15, 20, 25, 30, 35]  # Distance from DC to each store in km
4. BigM
1000  # A large constant for linearization

Decision variable:
1. TruckUsed
Binary variable \( u_t \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( t \in T \), where \( u_t = 1 \) if truck \( t \) is used, and \( u_t = 0 \) otherwise
2. StoreAssignment
Binary variable \( x_{st} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( s \in S, t \in T \), where \( x_{st} = 1 \) if store \( s \) is assigned to truck \( t \), and \( x_{st} = 0 \) otherwise
3. RouteDistance
Continuous variable \( d_t \geq 0 \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the total distance traveled by truck \( t \)

Objective:
Minimize the total distance traveled by all trucks
min: \sum_{t\in T}d_t

Constraint:
1. Each store must be assigned to exactly one truck
\sum_{t\in T}x_{st} = 1, \forall s \in S
2. Truck capacity cannot be exceeded
\sum_{s\in S}StoreDemands_s \cdot x_{st} \leq TruckCapacities_t, \forall t \in T
3. Distance calculation for each truck (using farthest store visited)
d_t \geq Distances_s \cdot x_{st}, \forall s \in S, t \in T
4. Truck usage constraint (if any store is assigned)
\sum_{s\in S}x_{st} \leq |S| \cdot u_t, \forall t \in T

Type:
