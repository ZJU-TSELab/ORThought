A milk supplier needs to deliver milk to all scheduled customers, with the supplier's warehouse location coordinates being (5, 5), and 5 trucks with a capacity of 25 units of milk can be used for delivery. It is known that there are 20 customer points to be delivered to, with coordinates (5.2, 3.8), (8.7, 4.0), (7.9, 8.8), (1.6, 4.1), (8.3, 2.4), (4.5, 3.3), (3.7, 6.2), (8.9, 5.5), (8.4, 0.3), (0.7, 8.9), (0.3, 7.8), (5.5, 5.7), (2.4, 1.8), (3.5, 6.9), (5.4, 7.8), (2.8, 4.0), (4.9, 1.1), (6.8, 4.3), (9.2, 4.3), (0.1, 8.6), and the milk requirements are 6, 2, 7, 3, 4, 8, 7, 7, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 7 units respectively. Every truck departs from the warehouse, delivers milk to customers on the planned route, and returns to the warehouse after delivering to all customers. Under the condition of meeting all customer demands, what is the shortest total driving distance for the trucks? (Assuming that the distance between each point is calculated based on the straight-line distance.)
