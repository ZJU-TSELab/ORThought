# Set
# C: The set of containers to be packed.
Set:
1. Containers
The set of containers, \( C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \)

# Parameter
# TruckWidth: The fixed width of the truck bed in meters.
# Diameter_c: The diameter of container c.
# Radius_c: The radius of container c, calculated as Diameter_c / 2.
Parameter:
1. TruckWidth
2.5 (meters)
2. Diameters
The diameter of each container \( c \in C \) (meters): [1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7]
3. Radii
The radius of each container \( c \in C \) (meters): [0.6, 0.55, 0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35]

# Decision variable
# x_c, y_c: The continuous variables representing the center coordinates of container c.
# L: A continuous variable representing the required length of the truck bed.
Decision variable:
1. x_c
Continuous variable \( x_c \geq 0 \) for all \( c \in C \), representing the x-coordinate (length dimension) of container \( c \)'s center.
2. y_c
Continuous variable \( y_c \geq 0 \) for all \( c \in C \), representing the y-coordinate (width dimension) of container \( c \)'s center.
3. L
Continuous variable \( L \geq 0 \), representing the required length of the truck bed.

# Objective
# Minimize the required length of the truck bed.
Objective:
Minimize the truck length
min: \( L \)

# Constraint
# 1. Containers must fit within the truck width (respecting boundaries).
# 2. Containers must fit within the required truck length (respecting boundaries).
# 3. No two containers i and j can overlap. This is enforced by ensuring the distance between
#    their centers is at least the sum of their radii.
Constraint:
1. Width Boundary
\( y_c + \text{Radius}_c \leq \text{TruckWidth}, \quad \forall c \in C \)
\( y_c \geq \text{Radius}_c, \quad \forall c \in C \)
2. Length Boundary
\( x_c + \text{Radius}_c \leq L, \quad \forall c \in C \)
\( x_c \geq \text{Radius}_c, \quad \forall c \in C \)
3. Non-Overlapping
\( (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 \geq (\text{Radius}_i + \text{Radius}_j)^2, \quad \forall i, j \in C, i < j \)

# Type
# The problem has continuous variables. The non-overlapping constraint is a non-convex
# quadratic constraint, making this a Non-Convex Quadratically Constrained Program (QCQP),
# a specific type of Nonlinear Program (NLP).
