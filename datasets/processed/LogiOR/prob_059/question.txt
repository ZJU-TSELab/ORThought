A logistics company needs to pack 6 heavy cylindrical containers into a specialized truck bed. The truck bed has a fixed width of 2.5 meters, and the company wants to find the minimum possible length required to fit all containers. The diameters of the 6 containers (in meters) are: [1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7].

The containers must be placed flat on the truck bed according to the following rules:
1.  Each container must be fully contained within the truck bed's boundaries.
2.  No two containers can overlap.
3.  The goal is to find an arrangement that minimizes the total length of the truck bed used.

The position of each container is determined by the (x, y) coordinates of its center. The x-axis runs along the length of the truck, and the y-axis runs along its fixed width.
