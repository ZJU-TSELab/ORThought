A logistics company needs to deliver goods to 15 customers over a 5-day workweek (Monday to Friday). Each customer has specific delivery frequency requirements: 3 customers require daily deliveries, 5 require deliveries every other day, and 7 require weekly deliveries. The company has 3 available vehicles, each with a capacity of 200 units. The distances between customers and the depot are given in the following matrix (in km):

Each customer's daily demand (in units) is: [25, 30, 20, 15, 35, 40, 18, 22, 28, 32, 19, 21, 26, 24, 23]. The objective is to plan vehicle routes for each day of the week to satisfy all delivery requirements while minimizing total distance traveled.
