Set: 
1. Package
The set of packages, \( P = \{1, 2\} \)  # 1: Standard, 2: Express
2. ShippingMethod
The set of shipping methods, \( S = \{1, 2\} \)  # 1: Air freight, 2: Ground shipping

Parameter:
1. AirFreightCapacity
150  # in cubic meters
2. GroundShippingCapacity
210  # in cubic meters
3. AirFreightRequirement
[17, 5]  # in cubic meters
4. GroundShippingRequirement
[30, 13]  # in cubic meters
5. RevenuePerPackage
[40, 15]  # in dollars

Decision variable:
1. PackagesShipped
Integer variable, \( PackagesShipped[p][s] \forall p \in P, s \in S \), the number of packages shipped for package type \( p \) using shipping method \( s \).

Objective:
1. Maximize the total revenue.
max: \sum_{p \in P, s \in S} (PackagesShipped[p][s] * RevenuePerPackage[p])

Constraint:
1. Air freight capacity constraint.
\sum_{p \in P} (PackagesShipped[p][1] * AirFreightRequirement[p]) \leq AirFreightCapacity
2. Ground shipping capacity constraint.
\sum_{p \in P} (PackagesShipped[p][2] * GroundShippingRequirement[p]) \leq GroundShippingCapacity
3. Non-negativity constraint.
PackagesShipped[p][s] \geq 0 \forall p \in P, s \in S

Type:
Integer, Linear, Linear
