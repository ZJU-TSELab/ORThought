LogiFlow Solutions manages the distribution of two types of packages: Standard and Express. Each package must be transported entirely by air freight or entirely by ground shipping. A total of 150 cubic meters of air freight capacity and 210 cubic meters of ground shipping capacity are available. A Standard package requires either 17 cubic meters of air freight or 30 cubic meters of ground shipping, while an Express package requires either 5 cubic meters of air freight or 13 cubic meters of ground shipping. Each Standard package generates $40 in revenue, and each Express package generates $15 in revenue. How to maximize LogiFlow Solutions' total revenue from package distribution?
