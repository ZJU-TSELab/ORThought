Set:
1. Orders
The set of Orders, \( O = \{1, 2, ..., 8\} \)
2. Trucks
The set of Trucks, \( T = \{1, 2, 3\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProcessingTime
[4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3] (hours for each order)
2. ReentrantFactor
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1] (number of times each order must be processed)
3. TruckCapacity
[15, 18, 12] (maximum total processing hours per truck)
4. OperatingCost
[30, 25, 35] (cost per hour for each truck)

Decision variable:
1. Assignment
Binary variable \( x_{ot} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( o \in O, t \in T \), where \( x_{ot} = 1 \) if order \( o \) is assigned to truck \( t \), and \( x_{ot} = 0 \) otherwise
2. TruckUsed
Binary variable \( y_t \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( t \in T \), where \( y_t = 1 \) if truck \( t \) is used, and \( y_t = 0 \) otherwise

Objective:
Minimize total operating cost
min: \sum_{t\in T} \left( \sum_{o\in O} ProcessingTime_o \cdot ReentrantFactor_o \cdot x_{ot} \right) \cdot OperatingCost_t

Constraint:
1. Each order must be assigned to exactly one truck
\sum_{t\in T}x_{ot} = 1, \forall o \in O
2. Total processing time on each truck must not exceed its capacity
\sum_{o\in O} ProcessingTime_o \cdot ReentrantFactor_o \cdot x_{ot} \leq TruckCapacity_t, \forall t \in T
3. Truck usage indicator
\sum_{o\in O}x_{ot} \leq M \cdot y_t, \forall t \in T (where M is a large constant)
