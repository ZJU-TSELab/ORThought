Set:
1. Zones
The set of hotspot zones, \( I = \{\text{Commercial Center, University City, Tech Park, Tourist Area, Transit Hub}\} \).

Parameters:
1.  TotalScooters
    The total number of scooters to be deployed.
    1000
2.  Attractiveness
    A dictionary mapping each zone \(i \in I\) to its attractiveness value.
     \(\{\text{Commercial Center: 500, University City: 800, Tech Park: 700, Tourist Area: 600, Transit Hub: 900}\}\)
3.  TotalAttractiveness
    The sum of all attractiveness values.
    \(500 + 800 + 700 + 600 + 900 = 3500\)
4.  MinQuotaFactor
    The minimum allocation factor based on total fleet size.
    0.1
5.  TargetDeployment
    The ideal, attractiveness-weighted deployment for each zone \(i \in I\).
    \(\text{TargetDeployment}_i = \text{TotalScooters} \times \frac{\text{Attractiveness}_i}{\text{TotalAttractiveness}}\)

Decision Variable:
1.  Deployment
    Integer variable, \(n_i \ge 0\) for each zone \(i \in I\), representing the number of scooters to be deployed in that zone.

Objective:
1.  Minimize the network imbalance, defined as the sum of squared deviations from the target deployment.
    min: \(\sum_{i \in I} (n_i - \text{TargetDeployment}_i)^2\)

Constraints:
1.  Total Deployment Constraint
    The sum of scooters deployed in all zones must equal the total number of available scooters.
    \(\sum_{i \in I} n_i = \text{TotalScooters}\)
2.  Minimum Quota Constraint
    The number of scooters in each zone must be greater than or equal to a minimum quota, which is weighted by the zone's relative attractiveness.
    \(n_i \ge \text{TotalScooters} \times \text{MinQuotaFactor} \times \frac{\text{Attractiveness}_i}{\text{TotalAttractiveness}} \quad \forall i \in I\)
3.  Adjacency Constraint (New)
    The absolute difference in deployment between 'Commercial Center' and 'Transit Hub' must not exceed 50.
    \(|n_{\text{Commercial Center}} - n_{\text{Transit Hub}}| \le 50\)
4.  Operational Cluster Capacity Constraint (New)
    The total number of scooters in each operational cluster cannot exceed its capacity of 600.
    \(n_{\text{Commercial Center}} + n_{\text{Tourist Area}} \le 600\)
    \(n_{\text{University City}} + n_{\text{Tech Park}} + n_{\text{Transit Hub}} \le 600\)
