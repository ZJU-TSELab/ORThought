A fruit processing company, NatureBounty, specializes in producing two product lines: packaged fresh apples and bottled apple juice. NatureBounty grades apples on a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The company currently has 90,000 lbs of grade 7 apples and 110,000 lbs of grade 4 apples in inventory. To maintain product quality, the average grade of apples sold in packages must be at least 5, and the average grade of apples used for juice production must be at least 6. Additionally, the company has a production capacity constraint: it can process no more than 150,000 lbs of apples in total due to equipment limitations. Each pound of apples used for juice generates a revenue of $1.10 and incurs a variable cost of $0.80. Each pound of apples sold in packages generates a revenue of $0.35 and incurs a variable cost of $0.12. The company also has a marketing constraint: at least 20% of the total processed apples must be sold in packages to meet market demand. How to help NatureBounty maximize its profit while adhering to all constraints.
