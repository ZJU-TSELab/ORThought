Set:
1. facility
The set of production facilities, \( F = \{1, 2, 3\} \)
2. pollutant
The set of pollutants, \( P = \{1, 2\} \)  # 1: pollutant X, 2: pollutant Y

Parameter:
1. TreatmentCost
[12, 8, 18]
2. PollutantReduction
[
    [0.15, 0.35],  # facility 1
    [0.25, 0.20],  # facility 2
    [0.30, 0.40]   # facility 3
]
3. PollutionTarget
[25, 35]

Decision variable:
1. TreatmentAmount
Continuous variable, \( TreatmentAmount[f] \forall f \in F \), where \( TreatmentAmount[f] \) is the amount of waste treated at facility \( f \).

Objective:
1. Minimize the total cost of treating waste.
min: \sum_{f \in F} TreatmentCost[f] * TreatmentAmount[f]

Constraint:
1. Pollution reduction constraint.
PollutantReduction[f][p] * TreatmentAmount[f] \geq PollutionTarget[p] \forall p \in P, f \in F
2. Treatment amount non-negativity constraint.
TreatmentAmount[f] \geq 0 \forall f \in F

Type:
Continuous, Linear, Linear
