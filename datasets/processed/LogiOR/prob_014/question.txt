A logistics company needs to deliver packages to multiple booked customer, the logistics center's coordinates are (0, 0), and the company has 5 trucks with a capacity of 15 units of packages available for delivery. It is known that there are 12 customer points that need to be delivered, with coordinates (4.36, -2.75), (-7.29, -3.22), (-8.74, -2.47), (-0.68, -5.15), (-0.39, -3.49), (-6.06, -5.52), (-2.67, 9.32), (9.91, 7.87), (2.03, -2.98), (2.33, -1.47), (5.1, -2.08), (-8.04, -9.78), and the demands are 6, 7, 1, 10, 8, 7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4 units of packages respectively. Trucks start from the logistics center, complete the delivery on the planned route, and then return to the logistics center. The number of trucks used should be less than or equal to the number of trucks owned by the company. Under the condition of meeting all customer demands, what is the shortest total driving distance for the trucks? (Assuming the distance between each point is calculated based on the straight-line distance.)
