Set:
1. Ships
The set of ships, \( S = \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J\} \)
2. Berths
The set of berths, \( B = \{B1, B2, B3\} \)
3. Dependencies
The set of dependencies, \( D = \{(A, C), (D, E), (B, G), (H, I), (G, J)\} \)  # where each tuple represents a dependency where the first ship must complete its operation before the second ship can start its operation.

Parameter:
1. ArrivalTime
# The estimated arrival time of each ship
[2, 5, 10, 12, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40] # in hours
2. OperationTime
# The required operation time for each ship at the berth
[8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 11, 8, 12, 5, 9] # in hours
3. RapidTransshipmentBonus
# The bonus for rapid transshipment
50000 # in currency units
4. MaxTransshipmentGap
# The maximum time gap for rapid transshipment to qualify for the bonus
2 # in hours
5. WaitingCost
# The cost of waiting per hour
2000 # in currency units
6. MaxTime
# The maximum time for the scheduling horizon
72 # in hours

Decision variable:
1. StartTime
Continuous variable, \(StartTime_i \forall i \in Ships\), where \( StartTime_i \) is the start time of ship \( i \) at its assigned berth.
2. Assignment
Binary variable, \(Assignment_{ib} \forall i \in Ships, b \in Berths\), where \(Assignment_{ib} = 1\) if vessel \(i\) is assigned to berth \(b\), and 0 otherwise.
3. Precedence
Binary variable, \(Precedence_{ij} \forall i, j \in Ships, i \neq j\), where \(Precedence_{ij} = 1\) if vessels \(i\) and \(j\) are assigned to the same berth and \(i\) is serviced before \(j\), and 0 otherwise.
4. DependencySatisfaction
Binary variable, \(DependencySatisfaction_{p} \forall p \in Dependencies\), where \(DependencySatisfaction_p = 1\) if the dependency \(p\) is satisfied (i.e., the dependent ship starts its operation within the allowed time gap after the predecessor ship completes its operation), and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
1. Maximize the total rapid transshipment bonus and minimize the total waiting cost.
max: \sum_{p \in Dependencies} RapidTransshipmentBonus * DependencySatisfaction_p - \sum_{i \in Ships} WaitingCost * (StartTime_i - ArrivalTime_i)

Constraint:
1. Each ship must be assigned to exactly one berth.
\sum_{b \in Berths} Assignment_{ib} = 1 \forall i \in Ships
2. The start time of each ship must be after its arrival time.
StartTime_i \geq ArrivalTime_i \forall i \in Ships
3. The start time of each ship plus its operation time must not exceed the maximum time.
StartTime_i + OperationTime_i \leq MaxTime \forall i \in Ships
4. The precedence relation must be respected.
StartTime_j \geq StartTime_i + OperationTime_i \forall (i, j) \in Dependencies
5. The berth assignment must be non-overlapping for ships assigned to the same berth.
StartTime_i + OperationTime_i \leq StartTime_j + M * (1 - Precedence_{ij}) + M * (2 - Assignment_{ib} - Assignment_{jb}) \forall i, j \in Ships, i \neq j, b \in Berths
StartTime_j + OperationTime_j \leq StartTime_i + M * Precedence_{ij} + M * (2 - Assignment_{ib} - Assignment_{jb}) \forall i, j \in Ships, i \neq j, b \in Berths
6. The bonus logic constraint.
StartTime_j - (StartTime_i + OperationTime_i) \leq MaxTransshipmentGap + M * (1 - DependencySatisfaction_p) \forall p=\(i, j\) \in Dependencies
