A container terminal needs to allocate berths for a fleet of 10 cargo ships within the next 72 hours. The terminal has 3 available berths (B1, B2, B3). Due to interdependencies where some ships carry import/export goods required by other ships, there are collaborative operation requirements between them. Specifically, ship C can only start loading after ship A completes unloading; ship E can only start loading after ship D completes unloading... To incentivize efficient collaboration, a **¥50,000 "rapid transshipment" bonus** can be earned if the start time of a dependent task (e.g., C starting to load) immediately follows the completion time of its predecessor task (e.g., A completing unloading) with a time gap of 2 hours or less. Ship information and operational requirements are shown in Table 1. The objective is to assign each ship a unique berth and a conflict-free berthing time window to maximize the total rapid transshipment bonus while minimizing the ships' waiting time costs in the port** (¥2,000 per hour).
