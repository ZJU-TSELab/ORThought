A regional beverage distributor needs to optimize the delivery of 5 products (A,B,C,D,E) from their central warehouse (Node 1) to 3 retail stores (Nodes 4,5,6) through a transportation network with 6 nodes and 8 directed arcs. Each arc has a maximum capacity (in pallets/day) and transportation cost ($/pallet): (1→2): 20 pallets, $3; (1→3): 15 pallets, $4; (2→3): 10 pallets, $2; (2→4): 12 pallets, $5; (3→5): 18 pallets, $3; (3→6): 10 pallets, $6; (4→5): 8 pallets, $1; (5→6): 15 pallets, $2. The daily demands are: Store 4 needs 8 pallets (A:3, B:2, C:3), Store 5 needs 12 pallets (B:4, D:5, E:3), Store 6 needs 10 pallets (A:2, C:3, E:5). The warehouse can supply up to 30 pallets total daily. The goal is to satisfy all demands at minimum transportation cost while respecting arc capacities and product-specific requirements.
