A delivery company has a fleet of vehicles at a certain location, consisting of 3 trucks. Each truck has a load limit of 1 ton (i.e., 1000 kg) and a speed of 30 km/h. The delivery fleet needs to provide pickup and delivery services for a group of customers. Each order has independent time windows for the pickup point and the delivery point. Below are the detailed customer order details:

The delivery fleet departs from the depot at coordinates (0, 0), serves all orders, and then returns to the depot. How should the routes be planned to minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks? (Distances are calculated as Euclidean distances.)
