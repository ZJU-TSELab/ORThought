Set:
1.  Area
    [cite_start]The set of areas with available taxis, \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) # 1: A1, 2: A2, 3: A3 [cite: 12]
2.  Hotspot
    [cite_start]The set of passenger demand hotspots, \( H = \{1, 2, 3\} \) # 1: H1, 2: H2, 3: H3 [cite: 12]

Parameter:
1.  AvailableTaxis
   [25, 40, 35] # number of available taxis in each area 
2.  Demand
    [30, 50, 40] # number of passengers demanding taxis at each hotspot 
3.  DeadheadingCost
    [16, 28, 24], [20, 12, 32], [24, 20, 16] # cost to dispatch a taxi from an area to a hotspot
    # The deadheading costs data in the table is already adjusted to reflect a 20% reduction.
4.  SurchargeCoefficient
    0.5 # coefficient relating driver supply to the square of the surcharge 
5.  BaseFare 
    15.0 # fixed base fare for each successful dispatch

Decision variable:
1.  DispatchAmount
Integer variable, \( DispatchAmount[a][h] \forall a \in A, h \in H \), the number of taxis dispatched from area \( a \) to hotspot \( h \).
2.  Surcharge
Continuous variable, \( Surcharge[h] \forall h \in H \), the dynamic surcharge set for hotspot \( h \). 

Objective:
1.  Maximize the total profit. 
    max: \( \sum_{h \in H} ((BaseFare + Surcharge[h]) * \sum_{a \in A} DispatchAmount[a][h]) - \sum_{a \in A} \sum_{h \in H} (DeadheadingCost[a][h] * DispatchAmount[a][h]) \)

Constraint:
1.  Area supply constraint.
 \sum_{h \in H} DispatchAmount[a][h] \leq AvailableTaxis[a] \forall a \in A \
2.  Hotspot demand constraint.
\sum_{a \in A} DispatchAmount[a][h] \leq Demand[h] \forall h \in H \
3.  Surcharge-supply relationship constraint.
 \sum_{a \in A} DispatchAmount[a][h] = SurchargeCoefficient * Surcharge[h]^2 \forall h \in H \
4.  Non-negativity constraint.
   DispatchAmount[a][h] \geq 0 \forall a \in A, h \in H \
   Surcharge[h] \geq 0 \forall h \in H \
