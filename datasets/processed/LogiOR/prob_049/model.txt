Set:
1. Area
The set of areas, \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)  # 1: Packaging Area, 2: Loading Dock, 3: Sorting Facility, 4: Storage Facility

Parameter:
1. PackagingAreaCoordinates
(0, 0)  # coordinates of the Packaging Area
2. LoadingDockCoordinates
(800, 600)  # coordinates of the Loading Dock
3. DistanceBetweenPackagingAndLoading
1400
4. DailyTrips
[[0, 20, 15, 10], [20, 0, 25, 30], [15, 25, 0, 40], [10, 30, 40, 0]]  # daily trips between areas
5. CostPerMeterPerTrip
0.50  # cost of moving goods per meter per trip
6. DistributionCenterBoundaries
(0, 0, 800, 600)  # boundaries of the distribution center (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)
7. MinimalDistance
100  # minimal distance between two areas in meters

Decision variable:
1. DistanceBetweenSortingAndStorage
Continuous variable, \( DistanceBetweenSortingAndStorage \), the distance between the Sorting Facility and Storage Facility in meters.
2. DistanceBetweenSortingAndPackaging
Continuous variable, \( DistanceBetweenSortingAndPackaging \), the distance between the Sorting Facility and Packaging Area in meters.
3. DistanceBetweenSortingAndLoading
Continuous variable, \( DistanceBetweenSortingAndLoading \), the distance between the Sorting Facility and Loading Dock in meters.
4. DistanceBetweenStorageAndPackaging
Continuous variable, \( DistanceBetweenStorageAndPackaging \), the distance between the Storage Facility and Packaging Area in meters.
5. DistanceBetweenStorageAndLoading
Continuous variable, \( DistanceBetweenStorageAndLoading \), the distance between the Storage Facility and Loading Dock in meters.

Objective:
1. Minimize the total daily transportation cost.
min: [(DailyTrips[1][2]+DailyTrips[2][1])*DistanceBetweenPackagingAndLoading + 
       (DailyTrips[1][3]+DailyTrips[3][1])*DistanceBetweenSortingAndPackaging + 
       (DailyTrips[1][4]+DailyTrips[4][1])*DistanceBetweenStorageAndPackaging + 
       (DailyTrips[2][3]+DailyTrips[3][2])*DistanceBetweenSortingAndLoading + 
       (DailyTrips[2][4]+DailyTrips[4][2])*DistanceBetweenStorageAndLoading + 
       (DailyTrips[3][4]+DailyTrips[4][3])*DistanceBetweenSortingAndStorage] * CostPerMeterPerTrip

Constraint:
1. DistanceRelationships
DistanceBetweenSortingAndLoading + DistanceBetweenSortingAndPackaging == DistanceBetweenPackagingAndLoading
DistanceBetweenStorageAndPackaging + DistanceBetweenStorageAndLoading == DistanceBetweenPackagingAndLoading
DistanceBetweenSortingAndStorage <= DistanceBetweenPackagingAndLoading
2. MinimalDistanceConstraint
DistanceBetweenSortingAndStorage >= MinimalDistance
DistanceBetweenSortingAndLoading >= MinimalDistance
DistanceBetweenSortingAndPackaging >= MinimalDistance
DistanceBetweenStorageAndLoading >= MinimalDistance
DistanceBetweenStorageAndPackaging >= MinimalDistance
