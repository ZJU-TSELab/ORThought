Set:
1. CustomerLocation 
The set of customer locations, \( C = \{C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6\} \) 
2. Location
The set of locations, \( L = \{Depot\} \cup C \)

Parameter:
1. FlightTime
[[0, 8, 12, 15, 7, 10, 14], 
 [8, 0, 5, 11, 6, 9, 13], 
 [12, 5, 0, 7, 10, 4, 8], 
 [15, 11, 7, 0, 9, 6, 5], 
 [7, 6, 10, 9, 0, 3, 11], 
 [10, 9, 4, 6, 3, 0, 7], 
 [14, 13, 8, 5, 11, 7, 0]] # flight time in minutes between locations

Decision variable:
1. Route
Binary variable, \( Route[i][j] \) for \( i, j \in L \), where \( Route[i][j] = 1 \) if the drone travels directly from location \( i \) to location \( j \), and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
1. Minimize the total flight time.
min: \sum_{i \in L, j \in L} (FlightTime[i][j] * Route[i][j])

Constraint:
1. Each customer location must be visited exactly once. 
\sum_{i \in L} Route[i][j] = 1 \forall j \in C 
2. The drone must start from and return to the depot after visiting all customer locations.
\sum_{j \in C} Route[Depot][j] = 1
\sum_{i \in C} Route[i][Depot] = 1
3. Subtour elimination constraints (to prevent subtours).
\sum_{i \in C} Route[i][j] - \sum_{k \in C} Route[j][k] = 0 \forall j \in C, j \neq Depot
