A delivery company is using a drone to make a series of urgent deliveries to 6 specific customer locations (C1 to C6) within a dense urban area. The drone must start from its depot, visit each of the 6 customer locations exactly once to drop off a package, and then return to the depot. The company has calculated the flight time (in minutes) between all pairs of locations (depot and customer sites), considering air-traffic restrictions and optimal flight paths.
