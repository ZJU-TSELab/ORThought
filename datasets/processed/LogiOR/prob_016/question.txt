A certain urban delivery company needs to provide fresh produce delivery services to 10 customer locations distributed across the city and surrounding areas. The company operates two distribution centers, A and B. Distribution center A is located at coordinates (-5, -5) and has 3 refrigerated trucks with a capacity of 20 tons each. Distribution center B is located at coordinates (5, 5) and has 3 refrigerated trucks with a capacity of 18 tons each. The coordinates of the 10 customers are as follows: (-4.53, -5.12), (2.14, 5.85), (-4.88, -8.33), (2.24, 1.63), (3.91, -5.88), (-1.1, 0.25), (7.92, -3.4), (-1.89, -5.0), (0.72, -8.8), (-1.88, -2.89). Their respective fresh produce demands are 2, 2, 9, 1, 4, 4, 10, 6, 4, and 4 tons. The delivery requirements are as follows: 1. Each truck must depart from its assigned distribution center and return to the same distribution center after completing deliveries; 2. Each customer must be visited exactly once. Under these conditions, what is the shortest total travel distance for the trucks? (The distance between two points is calculated as the straight-line distance.)
