Set:
1. Parcels
The set of parcels, \( I = \{1, 2, ..., 8\} \)
2. Trucks
The set of trucks, \( J = \{1, 2, 3\} \)
3. Synergy Pairs
The set of parcel pairs with a synergy bonus, \( P = \{(1, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 8), (5, 7)\} \)

Parameter:
1. Parcel Weights (kg)
\( w = [35, 45, 25, 50, 30, 40, 20, 55] \)
2. Base Revenues ($)
\( r = [50, 75, 40, 80, 60, 65, 35, 90] \)
3. Truck Capacities (kg)
\( C = [100, 120, 80] \)
4. Synergy Bonuses ($)
\( s_{1,3}=25, s_{2,5}=30, s_{2,6}=20, s_{4,8}=40, s_{5,7}=22 \) (and \( s_{ik}=0 \) for all other pairs)

# Decision variable
# x_ij: A binary variable that indicates the assignment of parcels to trucks.
Decision variable:
1. AssignmentVariable
Binary variable,  \( x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( i \in I, j \in J \), where \( x_{ij} = 1 \) if parcel \( i \) is assigned to truck \( j \), and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize total revenue
# To maximize the total revenue, which is the sum of the base revenues for all parcels 
# plus the sum of all achieved synergy bonuses. A bonus for pair (i,k) is achieved if
# both parcels are assigned to the same truck j.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} r_i \cdot x_{ij} + \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{(i,k) \in P} s_{ik} \cdot x_{ij} \cdot x_{kj} \)

# Constraint
Constraint:
1. Parcel Assignment
# Each parcel must be assigned to exactly one truck.
\( \sum_{j \in J} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall i \in I \)
2. Truck Capacity
# For each truck, the sum of the weights of the parcels assigned to it must not exceed its capacity.
\( \sum_{i \in I} w_i \cdot x_{ij} \leq C_j, \quad \forall j \in J \)
