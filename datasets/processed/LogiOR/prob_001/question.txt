RapidLink Logistics, a regional delivery company, needs to optimize its daily outbound operations from its main distribution hub. Today, they have 3 delivery trucks of varying capacities and 8 high-priority parcels that must be shipped. The goal is to assign each of the 8 parcels to exactly one of the three trucks to maximize the total revenue for the day.

The total revenue is composed of two parts: a standard shipping fee for each parcel and a significant synergy bonus that is gained when specific pairs of parcels are placed in the *same* truck. These bonuses arise because certain parcels are headed to the same dense urban block or large corporate campus, allowing for a much more efficient final-mile delivery.

The capacities of the three available trucks are:
- Truck 1: 100 kg
- Truck 2: 120 kg
- Truck 3: 80 kg

The details for the 8 high-priority parcels are listed below:
| Parcel ID | Weight (kg) | Base Revenue ($) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 35 | 50 |
| 2 | 45 | 75 |
| 3 | 25 | 40 |
| 4 | 50 | 80 |
| 5 | 30 | 60 |
| 6 | 40 | 65 |
| 7 | 20 | 35 |
| 8 | 55 | 90 |

Additionally, the logistics team has identified specific pairs of parcels that generate a synergy bonus if shipped in the same truck. These pairings and their associated bonuses are:
| Parcel Pair | Synergy Bonus ($) | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (1, 3) | 25 | Same residential complex |
| (2, 5) | 30 | Same industrial park |
| (2, 6) | 20 | Neighboring corporate offices |
| (4, 8) | 40 | Both are heavy-lift items for one client |
| (5, 7) | 22 | Same downtown skyscraper |

The company must decide which parcels go into which truck, respecting the weight capacity of each truck, to achieve the maximum possible total revenue.
