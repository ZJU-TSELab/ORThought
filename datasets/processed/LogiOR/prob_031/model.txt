Set:
1. Supplier
The set of suppliers, \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \) 
2. ShipmentType
The set of shipment types, \( T = \{1, 2, 3\} \)  # 1: large, 2: medium, 3: small

Parameter:
1. CostPerShipment
[5.2, 4.7, 3.5]
2. Percent
[[45, 35, 20], [30, 45, 25], [15, 20, 65]]
3. Demand
[500, 300, 300]
4. MaxShipment
[700, 700, 700]

Decision variable:
1. ShipmentNum
Integer variable, \( ShipmentNum[s] \forall s \in S \), where \( ShipmentNum[s] \) is the number of shipments contracted from supplier \( s \).

Objective:
1. Minimize the total cost of shipments.
min: \sum_{s \in S} CostPerShipment[s] * ShipmentNum[s]

Constraint:
1. Shipment number constraint.
ShipmentNum[s] \leq MaxShipment[s] \forall s \in S
2. Demand satisfaction constraint.
\sum_{s \in S} Percent[s][g] * ShipmentNum[s] \geq Demand[g] \forall g \in T
3. Shipment number non-negativity constraint.
ShipmentNum[s] \geq 0 \forall s \in S

Type:
Integer, Linear, Linear
