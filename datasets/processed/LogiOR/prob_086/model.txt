Set:
1.  CandidateCities
    The set of candidate cities, \( C = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)
2.  Hospitals
    The set of hospitals to be served, \( H = \{1, 2, 3\} \)

Parameter:
1.  ConstructionCost
    [8, 7, 9, 7.5] # Construction cost for each city c ∈ C in ¥M
2.  Distances
    [[50, 80, 120], [60, 40, 90], [110, 70, 50], [130, 100, 60]] # Distance from city c ∈ C to hospital h ∈ H in km
3.  NumToSelect
    2 # The number of centers to be established
4.  MaxJointFailureProb
    0.1 # The maximum allowed joint supply failure probability for each hospital
5.  ProbCoeff
    0.00005 # Coefficient for the transportation failure probability calculation

Decision variable:
1.  SelectCity
    Binary variable, \( SelectCity[c] \forall c \in C \), equals 1 if a center is built in city \(c\), 0 otherwise.

Objective:
1.  Minimize the total construction cost.
    min: \( \sum_{c \in C} ConstructionCost[c] \cdot SelectCity[c] \)

Constraint:
1.  Total number of centers constraint.
    \( \sum_{c \in C} SelectCity[c] = NumToSelect \)
2.  Reliability constraint for each hospital.
    \( \prod_{c \in C} (1 - (1 - ProbCoeff \cdot Distances[c][h]^2) \cdot SelectCity[c]) < MaxJointFailureProb \forall h \in H \)
3.  Variable domain constraints.
    \( SelectCity[c] \in \{0, 1\} \forall c \in C \)
