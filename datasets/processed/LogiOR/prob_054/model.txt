Sets:
1.  Categories C: The set of product categories, C = {1, 2, ..., 10}.
2.  Variants Vc: The set of variants for each category c in C, Vc = {A, B, C, D, E}.

Parameters:
1.  Resource Limits:
    WeightLimit = 12 (tons)
    VolumeLimit = 35 (m³)
    PowerLimit = 40 (kW)
    TimeLimit = 100 (hours)
2.  Product Data: For each c in C, v in Vc:
    Weight_cv: Weight of variant v in category c.
    Volume_cv: Volume of variant v in category c.
    Power_cv: Power consumption of variant v in category c.
    Time_cv: Cool-down time for variant v in category c.
    Profit_cv: Profit of variant v in category c.
3.  Synergy Bonus:
    BonusProfit = 150

Decision Variables:
1.  Primary Selection x_cv: A binary variable, where x_cv = 1 if variant v from category c is selected, and 0 otherwise.
2.  Synergy Indicator y: A binary variable, where y = 1 if the specific synergistic combination of products is selected, and 0 otherwise.

Objective Function:
Maximize the total profit, which includes the base profit from all selected items plus any synergy bonuses.

Maximize Z = ( sum_{c in C} sum_{v in Vc} Profit_cv * x_cv ) + (BonusProfit * y)

Constraints:
1.  Unique Selection per Category: Exactly one variant must be chosen from each category.
    sum_{v in Vc} x_cv = 1, for all c in C
2.  Weight Capacity: The total weight of selected variants must not exceed the truck's limit.
    sum_{c in C} sum_{v in Vc} Weight_cv * x_cv <= WeightLimit
3.  Volume Capacity: The total volume of selected variants must not exceed the truck's limit.
    sum_{c in C} sum_{v in Vc} Volume_cv * x_cv <= VolumeLimit
4.  Power Capacity: The total refrigeration power required must not exceed the truck's limit.
    sum_{c in C} sum_{v in Vc} Power_cv * x_cv <= PowerLimit
5.  Cool-Down Time Capacity: The total cool-down time required must not exceed the truck's budget.
    sum_{c in C} sum_{v in Vc} Time_cv * x_cv <= TimeLimit
6.  Product Synergy: The synergy bonus variable y can only be 1 if both Fruit Variant B (1,B) and Baked Good Variant C (6,C) are selected.
    x_{1,B} + x_{6,C} - 2y >= 0
    y <= x_{1,B}
    y <= x_{6,C}
7.  Product Conflict: The combination of Seafood Variant A (5,A) and Dairy Variant A (3,A) is forbidden.
    x_{5,A} + x_{3,A} <= 1
