Sets:
1. Nodes
    The set of all locations, \( N = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \), where node 0 is the Food Bank (Depot) and nodes \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \) represent the supermarkets.
2. Items
    The set of all available donation items, \( I = \{\text{Milk, Bread, Vegetables, Meat, Fruit, Yogurt}\} \).

Parameters:
1. Item Priority \(p_i\)
    The priority weight for each item \(i \in I\).
2. Item Volume \(v_i\)
    The volume (m³) for each item \(i \in I\).
3. Item Weight \(w_i\)
    The weight (kg) for each item \(i \in I\).
4. Item Location \(L_i\)
    A mapping indicating which supermarket node \(j \in S\) an item \(i \in I\) belongs to.
5. Node Coordinates \((cx_j, cy_j)\)
    The coordinates (km) for each node \(j \in N\).
6. Travel Time \(t_{jk}\)
    The pre-calculated travel time (in minutes) between node \(j\) and node \(k\).
    \(t_{jk} = \frac{\sqrt{(cx_j - cx_k)^2 + (cy_j - cy_k)^2}}{\text{Speed}} \times 60\)
7. Truck Volume Capacity \(V_{max}\)
    The maximum volume capacity of the truck (2 m³).
8. Truck Weight Capacity \(W_{max}\)
    The maximum weight capacity of the truck (500 kg).
9. Total Time Available \(T_{max}\)
    The maximum operational time available (4 hours = 240 minutes).
10. Loading Time \(T_{load}\)
    The fixed time required for loading at each supermarket stop (20 minutes).

Decision Variables
1. Collect Item \(c_i\)
    Binary variable, \(c_i \in \{0, 1\}\) for each item \(i \in I\). \(c_i = 1\) if item \(i\) is collected, 0 otherwise.
2. Visit Supermarket \(y_j\)
    Binary variable, \(y_j \in \{0, 1\}\) for each supermarket \(j \in S\). \(y_j = 1\) if supermarket \(j\) is visited, 0 otherwise.
3. Travel Arc \(z_{jk}\)
    Binary variable, \(z_{jk} \in \{0, 1\}\) for each pair of nodes \(j, k \in N\). \(z_{jk} = 1\) if the truck travels directly from node \(j\) to node \(k\), 0 otherwise.

Objective:
1. Maximize Total Priority
    Maximize the sum of the priority weights of all collected items.
    \(\text{max:} \sum_{i \in I} p_i \cdot c_i\)

Constraints:
1. Volume Capacity Constraint
    The total volume of collected items must not exceed the truck's volume capacity.
    \(\sum_{i \in I} v_i \cdot c_i \le V_{max}\)
2. Weight Capacity Constraint
    The total weight of collected items must not exceed the truck's weight capacity.
    \(\sum_{i \in I} w_i \cdot c_i \le W_{max}\)
3. Time Constraint
    The total travel time plus total loading time must not exceed the available operational time.
    \(\sum_{j \in N} \sum_{k \in N, j \ne k} t_{jk} \cdot z_{jk} + \sum_{j \in S} T_{load} \cdot y_j \le T_{max}\)
4. Item Collection Logic
    An item can only be collected if its corresponding supermarket is visited.
    \(c_i \le y_{L_i} \quad \forall i \in I\)
5. Routing Flow Conservation
    The truck must leave each supermarket it visits exactly once.
    \(\sum_{k \in N, k \ne j} z_{jk} = y_j \quad \forall j \in S\)
    The truck must arrive at each supermarket it visits exactly once.
    \(\sum_{j \in N, j \ne k} z_{jk} = y_k \quad \forall k \in S\)
6. Depot Departure and Return
    The truck must leave the depot once and return to the depot once.
    \(\sum_{k \in S} z_{0k} = 1\)
    \(\sum_{j \in S} z_{j0} = 1\)
7. Subtour Elimination
    Constraints to prevent disconnected loops (e.g., using the MTZ formulation, which requires additional variables \(u_j\) for tour position). A simplified representation is to state the requirement: Ensure a single continuous tour starting and ending at the depot.
