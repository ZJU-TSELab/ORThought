A manufacturing company needs to procure 5 key components (C1-C5, fractional procurement allowed) from 3 potential suppliers (S1-S3) for the next quarter. Each supplier has different pricing, reliability scores (0-1 scale), and maximum supply capacities. The company has forecasted component demands and wants to minimize total procurement cost while ensuring: (1) at least 60% of each component comes from suppliers with reliability ≥0.8, (2) no more than 40% of total spend goes to any single supplier, and (3) all demand is met. The quarterly demand is [1200, 800, 1500, 900, 600] units for C1-C5 respectively. Supplier data: S1 offers prices [12,15,18,20,22] $/unit with reliability 0.85 and capacity 2000 units; S2 offers [14,16,17,19,21] $/unit with reliability 0.75 and capacity 1800 units; S3 offers [13,14,19,18,20] $/unit with with reliability 0.90 and capacity 2500 units.
