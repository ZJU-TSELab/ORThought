Set:
1. Hubs
   The set of potential hubs, \( H = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)
2. Stores
   The set of retail stores, \( S = \{1, 2, ..., 15\} \)

Parameter:
1. FixedCost_h
   The fixed daily operating cost for opening hub \( h \): [100000, 80000, 120000, 90000, 110000]
2. Capacity_h
   The maximum daily handling capacity of hub \( h \): [1000, 800, 1500, 1200, 900]
3. Reliability_h
   The operational reliability score of hub \( h \): [0.85, 0.9, 0.7, 0.95, 0.8]
4. Demand_s
   The daily demand of store \( s \): [151, 188, 174, 161, 111, 187, 199, 104, 116, 88, 121, 173, 100, 187, 199]
5. Distance_hs
   The distance matrix between hub \( h \) and store \( s \) as specified in the table.
6. TransportCost
   The variable transportation cost per unit per mile: 0.8
7. MinAvgReliability
   The minimum required average reliability of opened hubs: 0.9
8. Days
   The number of days in the planning horizon: 365

Decision variable:
1. OpenHub_h
   Binary variable \( x_h \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( h \in H \), where \( x_h = 1 \) if hub \( h \) is opened, and 0 otherwise.
2. AssignStore_hs
   Binary variable \( y_{hs} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( h \in H, s \in S \), where \( y_{hs} = 1 \) if store \( s \) is assigned to hub \( h \), and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize the total annual cost, which is the sum of daily fixed and transportation costs multiplied by the number of days.
min: \( \text{Days} \cdot \left( \sum_{h \in H} \text{FixedCost}_h \cdot x_h + \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{s \in S} \text{TransportCost} \cdot \text{Demand}_s \cdot \text{Distance}_{hs} \cdot y_{hs} \right) \)

Constraint:
1. Store Assignment
   Each store must be assigned to exactly one hub.
   \( \sum_{h \in H} y_{hs} = 1, \quad \forall s \in S \)
2. Hub Capacity
   The total demand of all stores assigned to a hub cannot exceed that hub's capacity. This constraint is only active if the hub is open.
   \( \sum_{s \in S} \text{Demand}_s \cdot y_{hs} \leq \text{Capacity}_h \cdot x_h, \quad \forall h \in H \)
3. Minimum Average Reliability
   The sum of reliability scores of all opened hubs must be greater than or equal to the minimum average reliability multiplied by the number of opened hubs.
   \( \sum_{h \in H} \text{Reliability}_h \cdot x_h \geq \text{MinAvgReliability} \cdot \left( \sum_{h \in H} x_h \right) \)
4. Logical Consistency
   A store can only be assigned to a hub if that hub is open.
   \( y_{hs} \leq x_h, \quad \forall h \in H, s \in S \)
