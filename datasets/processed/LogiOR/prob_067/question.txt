A distribution company is planning its logistics network for the upcoming year to serve 15 retail stores from 5 potential hub locations. The company aims to minimize its total annual operational cost, which consists of fixed daily costs for opening hubs and variable transportation costs for delivering goods.

The core decisions are which of the 5 potential hubs to open and which open hub should be assigned to serve each of the 15 retail stores.

Each potential hub has a specific daily operating cost, a maximum daily capacity, and an operational reliability score. The company has a strategic requirement that the average reliability of all opened hubs must be at least 90%. The transportation cost is fixed at $0.80 per unit per mile, and the planning horizon is a full year (365 days).

The plan must assign each store to exactly one hub, ensure that no hub's daily capacity is exceeded, meet the minimum average reliability standard, and minimize the total annual cost.
