Set:
This problem does not involve discrete sets.

Parameter:
1.  TotalOrdersAvailable
    The total number of orders that need to be delivered by crowdsourced riders during the peak period.
    1500
2.  OrdersPerRider
    The average number of orders a single crowdsourced rider can complete.
    12
3.  RevenuePerOrder
    The average revenue the platform earns for each completed order.
    15 # in dollars
4.  MinOrdersRequired
    The minimum number of orders that must be completed.
    1000
5.  MinBaseFee
    The minimum allowed base delivery fee for riders.
    3 # in dollars
6.  RiderModelCoeff_BaseFee
    The coefficient for the base delivery fee in the rider availability model.
    0.8
7.  RiderModelCoeff_Bonus
    The coefficient for the additional bonus in the rider availability model.
    17.0

Decision variable:
1.  BaseFee
    Continuous variable, \( b \), representing the base delivery fee offered per order.
2.  Bonus
    Continuous variable, \( p \), representing the additional bonus offered per order.
3.  OrdersCompleted
    Integer variable, \( c \), representing the total number of orders successfully completed.

Objective:
1.  Maximize the total profit.
    The objective is to maximize the total revenue from completed orders minus the total compensation paid to riders.
    max: \( c \times \text{RevenuePerOrder} - c \times (b + p) \)

Constraint:
1.  Rider Capacity Constraint
    The number of orders completed cannot exceed the total capacity of the available riders. The number of riders is determined by the compensation plan.
    \( c \leq \text{OrdersPerRider} \times (\text{RiderModelCoeff\_BaseFee} \times b^2 + \text{RiderModelCoeff\_Bonus} \times p) \)
2.  Order Availability Constraint
    The number of orders completed cannot be more than the total orders available.
    \( c \leq \text{TotalOrdersAvailable} \)
3.  Minimum Completion Constraint
    The number of completed orders must meet the platform's minimum target.
    \( c \geq \text{MinOrdersRequired} \)
4.  Minimum Fee Constraint
    The base delivery fee must meet the minimum requirement.
    \( b \geq \text{MinBaseFee} \)
5.  Non-negativity Constraint
    The additional bonus cannot be negative.
    \( p \geq 0 \)
