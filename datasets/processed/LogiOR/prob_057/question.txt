A logistics company needs to optimize its warehouse storage by selecting a subset of products to store that maximizes profit while considering space constraints and product compatibility. The warehouse has a total capacity of 500 cubic meters. There are 8 products available, each with a specific volume, profit, and compatibility restrictions (some products cannot be stored together due to safety or regulatory reasons). The products and their attributes are as follows:

| Product ID | Volume (m³) | Profit ($) | Incompatible Products |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| 1          | 80          | 1200       | 3, 5                   |
| 2          | 60          | 900        | 4                      |
| 3          | 40          | 700        | 1, 6                   |
| 4          | 70          | 1100       | 2, 7                   |
