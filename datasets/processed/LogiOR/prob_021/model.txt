Set:
1. Week
The set of weeks, \( W = \{1, 2, \dots, WeekNum\} \)

Parameter:
1. WeekNum
7
2. Demand
[6, 9, 12, 8, 5, 7, 4]
3. LongTermCost
240
4. LongTermWeekNum
7
5. ShortTermCost
390
6. SharedCost
220
7. SharedWeek
[2, 4, 5]
8. PromoCost
190
9. PromoMaxNum
2
10. PromoWeek
[4, 5, 6, 7]

Decision variable:
1. LongTermNum
Integer variable, \( LongTermNum \), where \( LongTermNum \) is the number of long-term forklifts leased.
2. ShortTermNum
Integer variable, \( ShortTermNum_{i} \forall i \in W\), where \( ShortTermNum_i \) is the number of short-term forklifts leased in week \( i \).
3. SharedNum
Integer variable, \( SharedNum \), where \( SharedNum \) is the number of shared forklifts leased.
4. PromoNum
Integer variable, \( PromoNum_{i} \forall i \in W\), where \( PromoNum_i \) is the number of promotional forklifts leased in week \( i \).

Objective:
1. Minimize the total leasing cost.
min: LongTermCost * LongTermNum * LongTermWeekNum + ShortTermCost * \sum_{i \in W} ShortTermNum_i + SharedCost * SharedNum * len(SharedWeek) + PromoCost * \sum_{i \in PromoWeek} PromoNum_i

Constraint:
1. The total number of forklifts leased must meet the demand for each week.
LongTermNum + ShortTermNum_i + PromoNum_i \geq Demand_i \forall i \in (W / SharedWeek)
2. The total number of forklifts leased must meet the demand for each week, considering shared forklifts.
LongTermNum + ShortTermNum_i + SharedNum + PromoNum_i \geq Demand_i \forall i \in SharedWeek
3. The number of promotional forklifts leased in each week must not exceed the maximum limit.
PromoNum_i \leq PromoMaxNum \forall i \in PromoWeek
4. The promotional forklifts can't be leased in weeks other than the promotional weeks.
PromoNum_i = 0 \forall i \in (W / PromoWeek)
