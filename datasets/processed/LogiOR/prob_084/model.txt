Set:
1.  OldTrucks
    The set of old diesel trucks, \( D = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)

Parameter:
1.  AnnualOperatingCostOld
    [80000, 85000, 78000, 92000, 88000] # Annual operating cost for each old diesel truck in ¥
2.  AnnualCarbonEmissionsOld
    [15, 16, 14, 18, 17] # Annual carbon emissions for each old diesel truck in tons
3.  AnnualOperatingCostNew
    30000 # Annual operating cost per new electric truck in ¥
4.  AnnualizedInvestmentNew
    120000 # Annualized investment cost per new electric truck in ¥
5.  CarbonTaxCoefficient
    80 # Coefficient for the carbon tax calculation
6.  MinFleetSize
    4 # Minimum number of trucks required in the fleet
7.  MaxNewTrucks
    3 # Maximum number of new electric trucks that can be purchased

Decision variable:
1.  KeepOldTruck
    Binary variable, \( KeepOldTruck[d] \forall d \in D \), equals 1 if old truck \( d \) is kept, 0 otherwise.
2.  BuyNewTrucks
    Integer variable, \( BuyNewTrucks \), the number of new electric trucks to purchase.

Objective:
1.  Minimize the total annual cost.
    min: \( \sum_{d \in D} (AnnualOperatingCostOld[d] \cdot KeepOldTruck[d]) + (AnnualOperatingCostNew + AnnualizedInvestmentNew) \cdot BuyNewTrucks + CarbonTaxCoefficient \cdot (\sum_{d \in D} (AnnualCarbonEmissionsOld[d] \cdot KeepOldTruck[d]))^2 \)

Constraint:
1.  Minimum fleet size constraint.
    \( \sum_{d \in D} KeepOldTruck[d] + BuyNewTrucks \geq MinFleetSize \)
2.  New truck purchase limit.
    \( BuyNewTrucks \leq MaxNewTrucks \)
3.  Variable domain constraints.
    \( KeepOldTruck[d] \in \{0, 1\} \forall d \in D \)
    \( BuyNewTrucks \geq 0 \), and integer
