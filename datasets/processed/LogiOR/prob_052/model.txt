Set:
1. Facilities
The set of potential facility locations, \( F = \{F1, F2, F3, F4, F5\} \)
2. Residentials
The set of residential areas, \( R = \{R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8\} \)

Parameter:
1. Coverage
Binary parameter \( a_{fr} \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( f \in F, r \in R \), where \( a_{fr} = 1 \) if facility \( f \) can cover residential \( r \) within 10 minutes, and \( a_{fr} = 0 \) otherwise. This is derived from the travel time table (e.g., \( a_{F1,R1} = 1 \) since 8 ≤ 10, but \( a_{F1,R2} = 0 \) since 12 > 10).

Decision variable:
1. FacilitySelected
Binary variable \( x_f \in \{0, 1\} \) for all \( f \in F \), where \( x_f = 1 \) if facility \( f \) is selected, and \( x_f = 0 \) otherwise

Objective:
The minimum number of facilities to select
min: \sum_{f\in F}x_f

Constraint:
1. Each residential area must be covered by at least one selected facility
\sum_{f\in F}a_{fr} \cdot x_f \geq 1, \forall r \in R

Type:
Binary, Linear, Linear
