# Model description for prob_093
# TODO: Add model description

Set:
1. CrudeOils
The set of crude oils, \( C = \{A, B\} \).
2. Gasolines
The set of gasoline types, \( G = \{I, II\} \).
3. PurchaseTiers
The set of purchase tiers for crude oil A, \( T = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

Parameter:
1. GasolinePrice
[4800, 5600] # Selling price in yuan/t for gasoline I and II.
2. MinAProportion
[0.5, 0.6] # Minimum proportion of crude oil A in gasoline I and II.
3. InitialInventory
[500, 1000] # Initial inventory in tons for crude oil A and B.
4. PurchaseCostA
[10000, 8000, 6000] # Purchase cost in yuan/t for crude oil A in each tier.
5. PurchaseLimitA
[500, 500, 500] # Maximum purchase quantity in tons for crude oil A in each tier.

Decision variable:
1. GasolineProduction
Continuous variable, \( g_i \), the tons of gasoline type \( i \) produced.
2. CrudeUsage
Continuous variable, \( u_{ij} \), the tons of crude oil \( i \) used to produce gasoline \( j \).
3. PurchaseA
Continuous variable, \( p_k \), the tons of crude oil A purchased in tier \( k \).

Objective:
Maximize the total profit, which is the revenue from selling gasoline minus the cost of purchasing crude oil A.
max: \sum_{j \in G} \text{GasolinePrice}[j] * g_j - \sum_{k \in T} \text{PurchaseCostA}[k] * p_k

Constraint:
1. Gasoline Composition
The amount of gasoline produced is the sum of the crude oils used.
g_j = \sum_{i \in C} u_{ij}, \forall j \in G
2. Crude A Proportion
The amount of crude A used in each gasoline type must meet the minimum proportion.
u_{A,j} \geq \text{MinAProportion}[j] * g_j, \forall j \in G
3. Crude A Availability
The total crude A used cannot exceed the initial inventory plus the purchased amount.
\sum_{j \in G} u_{A,j} \leq \text{InitialInventory}[A] + \sum_{k \in T} p_k
4. Crude B Availability
The total crude B used cannot exceed the initial inventory.
\sum_{j \in G} u_{B,j} \leq \text{InitialInventory}[B]
5. Tiered Purchasing
The amount purchased in each tier cannot exceed the limit for that tier. This is often modeled with additional binary variables to enforce the tiered pricing structure correctly.
p_k \leq \text{PurchaseLimitA}[k], \forall k \in T
(The provided code uses binary variables to enforce that a tier is only used if the previous one is full).
