# Model description for prob_099
# TODO: Add model description

Set:
1. Nodes
The set of communication nodes, \( N = \{A, B, C, D, E\} \).

Parameter:
1. Bandwidth
A 5x5 matrix, \( B_{ij} \), representing the bandwidth between node \( i \) and node \( j \).
[[0, 90, 85, 0, 65], [95, 0, 70, 65, 34], [60, 0, 0, 88, 80], [67, 30, 25, 0, 84], [0, 51, 0, 56, 0]]

Decision variable:
1. Path_AC
Binary variable, \( x_{ij} \), is 1 if the link from node \( i \) to node \( j \) is part of the path from A to C.
2. Path_CE
Binary variable, \( y_{ij} \), is 1 if the link from node \( i \) to node \( j \) is part of the path from C to E.
3. MinBandwidth
Continuous variable, \( b \), representing the minimum bandwidth of the entire A-C-E path.

Objective:
Maximize the minimum bandwidth of the path from A to E through C.
max: b

Constraint:
1. Flow Conservation (Path A to C)
   - One link must leave node A.
   - One link must enter node C.
   - For any other node \( k \notin \{A, C\} \), the number of links entering \( k \) must equal the number of links leaving \( k \).
   \sum_j x_{Aj} = 1, \sum_i x_{iC} = 1
   \sum_i x_{ik} = \sum_j x_{kj}, \forall k \in N \setminus \{A, C\}
2. Flow Conservation (Path C to E)
   - One link must leave node C.
   - One link must enter node E.
   - For any other node \( k \notin \{C, E\} \), the number of links entering \( k \) must equal the number of links leaving \( k \).
   \sum_j y_{Cj} = 1, \sum_i y_{iE} = 1
   \sum_i y_{ik} = \sum_j y_{kj}, \forall k \in N \setminus \{C, E\}
3. No Loops
The sum of links entering any intermediate node must be at most 1 for each path segment.
\sum_i x_{ik} \leq 1, \forall k \in N \setminus \{A, C\}
\sum_i y_{ik} \leq 1, \forall k \in N \setminus \{C, E\}
The two paths must not share any nodes other than C.
\sum_i x_{ik} + \sum_j y_{kj} \leq 1, \forall k \in N \setminus \{A, C, E\}
4. Bottleneck Bandwidth
The minimum bandwidth \( b \) must be less than or equal to the bandwidth of every selected link in both paths.
b \leq B_{ij} + M(1 - x_{ij}), \forall i,j \in N
b \leq B_{ij} + M(1 - y_{ij}), \forall i,j \in N
(where M is a large number)

Type:
Mixed-Integer, linear, linear
MILP
