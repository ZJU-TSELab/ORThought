Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{A, B\} \).

Parameter:
1. Profit
[30, 10] # Profit in £ per unit for each product.
2. ProductionTime
[6, 3] # Production time in hours per unit for each product.
3. MaxProductionTime
40 # Maximum total production time in hours per week.
4. MinBRatio
3 # The quantity of product B must be at least 3 times the quantity of product A.
5. MaxAStorage
4 # Maximum number of units of product A that can be stored.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( x_p \) for all \( p \in P \), representing the number of units of product \( p \) to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P} \text{Profit}[p] * x_p

Constraint:
1. Production Time
The total production time cannot exceed the maximum available time.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{ProductionTime}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxProductionTime}
2. Market Demand
The quantity of product B must be at least three times the quantity of product A.
x_B \geq \text{MinBRatio} * x_A
3. Storage Space
The quantity of product A cannot exceed the storage capacity.
x_A \leq \text{MaxAStorage}
4. Non-negativity
x_p \geq 0, \forall p \in P

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
