Set:
1. Workshop
The set of workshops, \( W = \{A, B, C, D\} \)
2. Component
The set of components, \( C = \{1, 2, 3\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProductionCapacity
A dictionary mapping workshop to its production capacity in hours.
2. ProductionRate
A dictionary mapping (workshop, component) to the production rate (units/hour).

Decision variable:
1. AllocatedHours
Continuous variable, \( x_{w,c} \) for \( w \in W, c \in C \), representing the hours allocated by workshop \( w \) to produce component \( c \).
2. CompletedProducts
Integer variable, \( z \), representing the total number of completed products.

Objective:
Maximize the number of completed products.
max: z

Constraint:
1. Component production constraint
For each component, the total number of units produced must be at least the number of completed products.
\sum_{w \in W} ProductionRate[w,c] * x_{w,c} \geq z, \forall c \in C
2. Workshop capacity constraint
For each workshop, the total hours allocated cannot exceed its capacity.
\sum_{c \in C} x_{w,c} \leq ProductionCapacity[w], \forall w \in W
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{w,c} \geq 0, \forall w \in W, c \in C \)
\( z \geq 0 \)

Type:
Mixed-Integer, linear, linear
MILP
