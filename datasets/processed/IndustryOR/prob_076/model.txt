Set:
1. Parts
The set of parts, \( P = \{1, 2, ..., 10\} \)
2. Machines
The set of machines, \( M = \{A, B, C\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProcessingCosts
The cost of processing part p on machine m, \( c_{pm} \).
[[10, 15, 20], [20, 25, 30], [30, 35, 40], [40, 45, 50], [50, 55, 60], [60, 65, 70], [70, 75, 80], [80, 85, 90], [90, 95, 100], [100, 105, 110]]
2. SetupCosts
The one-time setup cost for using a machine, \( d_m \).
[100, 135, 200]

Decision variable:
1. Assign
Binary variable, \( x_{pm} \), is 1 if part p is processed on machine m, 0 otherwise.
2. UseMachine
Binary variable, \( y_m \), is 1 if machine m is used, 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost, which is the sum of processing costs and setup costs.
min: \sum_{p \in P} \sum_{m \in M} c_{pm} * x_{pm} + \sum_{m \in M} d_m * y_m

Constraint:
1. Each part must be processed on exactly one machine.
\sum_{m \in M} x_{pm} = 1, \forall p \in P
2. If part 1 is processed on machine A, then part 2 must be processed on machine B or C.
x_{1,A} \leq x_{2,B} + x_{2,C}
3. If part 1 is processed on machine B or C, then part 2 must be processed on machine A.
x_{1,B} + x_{1,C} \leq x_{2,A}
4. Parts 3, 4, and 5 must be processed on specific machines.
x_{3,A} = 1
x_{4,B} = 1
x_{5,C} = 1
5. The number of parts processed on machine C cannot exceed 3.
\sum_{p \in P} x_{p,C} \leq 3
6. Link the assignment and machine usage variables. If a machine is used to process any part, its setup cost is incurred.
x_{pm} \leq y_m, \forall p \in P, m \in M

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
