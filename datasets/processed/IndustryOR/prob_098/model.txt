Set:
1. Components
The set of components, \( C = \{1, 2, 3\} \).
2. Spares
The set of possible numbers of spare parts, \( S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

Parameter:
1. Reliability
A 3x6 matrix, \( R_{cs} \), where \( R_{cs} \) is the reliability of component \( c \) with \( s \) spares.
[[0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0], [0.6, 0.75, 0.95, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
2. Price
[20, 30, 40] # Unit price in yuan for each component type.
3. Weight
[2, 4, 6] # Unit weight in kg for each component type.
4. MaxBudget
150 # Maximum total budget in yuan.
5. MaxWeight
20 # Maximum total weight in kg.

Decision variable:
1. NumSpares
Integer variable, \( n_c \) for all \( c \in C \), representing the number of spare parts installed for component \( c \).
(The provided code uses a binary formulation, which is more common for this type of problem).
2. Selection
Binary variable, \( x_{cs} \), is 1 if \( s \) spares are chosen for component \( c \), 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize the total system reliability. The system reliability is the product of the individual component reliabilities.
max: \prod_{c \in C} (\sum_{s \in S} R_{cs} * x_{cs})
This is a non-linear objective. It is often linearized by maximizing the sum of the logarithms of the reliabilities.
max: \sum_{c \in C} \log(\sum_{s \in S} R_{cs} * x_{cs})

Constraint:
1. Unique Selection
For each component, exactly one number of spares must be selected.
\sum_{s \in S} x_{cs} = 1, \forall c \in C
2. Budget
The total cost of all installed spare parts cannot exceed the budget.
\sum_{c \in C} \sum_{s \in S} (\text{Price}[c] * s * x_{cs}) \leq \text{MaxBudget}
3. Weight
The total weight of all installed spare parts cannot exceed the limit.
\sum_{c \in C} \sum_{s \in S} (\text{Weight}[c] * s * x_{cs}) \leq \text{MaxWeight}
