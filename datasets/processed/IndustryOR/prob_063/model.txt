Set:
1. Candidates
The set of candidates, \( C = \{F, G, H, I, J\} \).

Parameter:
1. Salary
[12000, 15000, 18000, 5000, 10000] # Salary requirement for each candidate.
2. SkillLevel
[2, 3, 4, 1, 2] # Skill level of each candidate.
3. Experience
[1, 2, 2, 5, 4] # Project management experience in years for each candidate.
4. Budget
40000 # Total budget for salaries.
5. MaxHires
4 # Maximum number of new employees to hire.
6. MinTotalSkill
8 # Minimum required total skill level of the hired team.
7. MinTotalExperience
8 # Minimum required total project management experience of the hired team.

Decision variable:
1. HireCandidate
Binary variable, \( y_c \) for \( c \in C \), is 1 if candidate c is hired, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize: \( \sum_{c \in C} \text{Salary}_c \cdot y_c \)

Constraint:
1. BudgetConstraint
The total salary of hired candidates cannot exceed the budget: \( \sum_{c \in C} \text{Salary}_c \cdot y_c \le 40000 \)
2. MaxHiresConstraint
The total number of hired candidates cannot exceed 4: \( \sum_{c \in C} y_c \le 4 \)
3. MinSkillConstraint
The total skill level of the hired team must be at least 8: \( \sum_{c \in C} \text{SkillLevel}_c \cdot y_c \ge 8 \)
4. MinExperienceConstraint
The total project management experience of the hired team must be at least 8 years: \( \sum_{c \in C} \text{Experience}_c \cdot y_c \ge 8 \)
5. MutualExclusion
At most one of candidates G and J can be hired: \( y_G + y_J \le 1 \)
