Set:
1. Weeks
The set of weeks, \( W = \{1, 2, ..., 8\} \)
2. Products
The set of food products, \( P = \{I, II\} \)

Parameter:
1. Demand
\( D_{p,w} \), Demand for product \( p \) in week \( w \).
   - I: [10000, 10000, 12000, 12000, 16000, 16000, 20000, 20000]
   - II: [6000, 7200, 8400, 10800, 10800, 12000, 12000, 12000]
2. InitialSkilledWorkers
50 # The number of skilled workers at the beginning.
3. TotalNewWorkers
50 # The total number of new workers to be trained.
4. ProdRate
[10, 6] # Production rate in kg/h for products I and II.
5. WorkHoursNormal
40 # Normal work hours per week.
6. WorkHoursOvertime
60 # Overtime work hours per week.
7. WageSkilledNormal
360 # Weekly wage for a skilled worker (normal/training).
8. WageSkilledOvertime
540 # Weekly wage for a skilled worker (overtime).
9. WageTrainee
120 # Weekly wage for a trainee.
10. WageNewlySkilled
240 # Weekly wage for a newly skilled worker.
11. TrainingRatio
3 # Trainees per skilled worker.
12. TrainingDuration
2 # Training duration in weeks.
13. DelayPenalty
[0.5, 0.6] # Penalty per kg per week of delay for products I and II.

Decision variable:
1. SWNormal
Integer variable, \( SW_{normal,w} \), number of skilled workers on normal time in week \( w \).
2. SWOvertime
Integer variable, \( SW_{overtime,w} \), number of skilled workers on overtime in week \( w \).
3. SWTrain
Integer variable, \( SW_{train,w} \), number of skilled workers training in week \( w \).
4. NWStart
Integer variable, \( NW_{start,w} \), number of new workers starting training in week \( w \).
5. Production
Continuous variable, \( P_{p,w} \), amount (kg) of product \( p \) produced in week \( w \).
6. Backlog
Continuous variable, \( B_{p,w} \), backlog amount (kg) for product \( p \) at the end of week \( w \).

Objective:
Minimize the total cost (wages and penalties).
min: \(\sum_{w \in W} (WageSkilledNormal \cdot (SW_{normal,w} + SW_{train,w}) + WageSkilledOvertime \cdot SW_{overtime,w} + WageTrainee \cdot \text{Trainees}_w + WageNewlySkilled \cdot \text{NewlySkilled}_w) + \sum_{w \in W} \sum_{p \in P} DelayPenalty_p \cdot B_{p,w}\)

Constraint:
1. Skilled Worker Allocation
\(SW_{normal,w} + SW_{overtime,w} + SW_{train,w} = \text{AvailableSkilled}_w, \forall w \in W\)
2. Total New Worker Training
\(\sum_{w=1}^{8-TrainingDuration+1} NW_{start,w} = TotalNewWorkers\)
3. Training Capacity
\(NW_{start,w} \leq TrainingRatio \cdot SW_{train,w}, \forall w \in W\)
4. Production Capacity
\(\sum_{p \in P} \frac{P_{p,w}}{ProdRate_p} \leq WorkHoursNormal \cdot SW_{normal,w} + WorkHoursOvertime \cdot SW_{overtime,w} + WorkHoursNormal \cdot \text{NewlySkilled}_w, \forall w \in W\)
5. Demand and Backlog Balance
\(B_{p,w-1} + P_{p,w} = D_{p,w} + B_{p,w}, \forall p \in P, w \in W\)
6. Non-negativity
All decision variables \(\geq 0\).
