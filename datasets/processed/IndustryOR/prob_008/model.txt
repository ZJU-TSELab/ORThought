Set:
1. Toys
The set of toys, \( T = \{\text{Trucks, Airplanes, Boats, Trains}\} \)

Parameter:
1. Profit
[5, 10, 8, 7] # Profit for each truck, airplane, boat, and train.
2. WoodRequired
[12, 20, 15, 10] # Wood units required for each toy.
3. SteelRequired
[6, 3, 5, 4] # Steel units required for each toy.
4. WoodAvailable
890 # Total units of wood available.
5. SteelAvailable
500 # Total units of steel available.

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfToys
Integer variable, \( x_t \), the number of toys of type \( t \) to manufacture.
2. ManufactureTruck
Binary variable, \( y_T \), 1 if trucks are manufactured, 0 otherwise.
3. ManufactureTrain
Binary variable, \( y_R \), 1 if trains are manufactured, 0 otherwise.
4. ManufactureBoat
Binary variable, \( y_B \), 1 if boats are manufactured, 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \(\sum_{t \in T} Profit_t \cdot x_t\)

Constraint:
1. Wood Availability
\(\sum_{t \in T} WoodRequired_t \cdot x_t \leq WoodAvailable\)
2. Steel Availability
\(\sum_{t \in T} SteelRequired_t \cdot x_t \leq SteelAvailable\)
3. Truck-Train Mutual Exclusivity
\(y_T + y_R \leq 1\)
(Requires linking \(x_t\) to \(y_t\) using Big-M, e.g., \(x_{Trucks} \leq M \cdot y_T\))
4. Boat-Airplane Implication
If boats are made, airplanes must be made.
\(x_{Airplanes} \geq y_B\)
(Requires linking \(x_{Boats}\) to \(y_B\) using Big-M, e.g., \(x_{Boats} \leq M \cdot y_B\))
5. Boat-Train Quantity Limit
The number of boats cannot exceed the number of trains.
\(x_{Boats} \leq x_{Trains}\)
6. Non-negativity
All decision variables \(\geq 0\).

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
