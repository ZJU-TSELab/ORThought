Set:
1. TransportModes
The set of transportation modes, \( M = \{\text{Horse, Bicycle, Handcart}\} \).

Parameter:
1. TotalProduce
1000 # Total units of produce to be transported.
2. PollutionLimit
1000 # Maximum allowable units of pollution.
3. MinHorseTrips
8 # Minimum number of trips to be made by horse.
4. Capacity
[55, 30, 40] # Carrying capacity per trip for Horse, Bicycle, and Handcart respectively.
5. Pollution
[80, 0, 0] # Pollution units per trip for Horse, Bicycle, and Handcart respectively.
6. BigM
1000 # A large number for linking constraints.

Decision variable:
1. NumTrips
Integer variable, \( x_m \) for \( m \in M \), represents the number of trips made using each mode.
2. UseBicycle
Binary variable, \( y_B \), is 1 if the bicycle is used.
3. UseHandcart
Binary variable, \( y_C \), is 1 if the handcart is used.

Objective:
Minimize: \( 80x_{\text{Horse}} \)

Constraint:
1. ProduceRequirement
The total amount of produce transported must be at least 1000 units: \( 55x_{\text{Horse}} + 30x_{\text{Bicycle}} + 40x_{\text{Handcart}} \ge 1000 \)
2. PollutionLimit
The total pollution generated must not exceed 1000 units: \( 80x_{\text{Horse}} \le 1000 \)
3. MinHorseTrips
At least 8 trips must be made by horse: \( x_{\text{Horse}} \ge 8 \)
4. ModeSelection
Exactly one of the bicycle or handcart must be chosen: \( y_B + y_C = 1 \)
5. LinkTripsToMode
Trips can only be made with a chosen mode (Big-M formulation):
- \( x_{\text{Bicycle}} \le 1000 \cdot y_B \)
- \( x_{\text{Handcart}} \le 1000 \cdot y_C \)
