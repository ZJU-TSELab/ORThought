Set:
1. Product
The set of products, \( P = \{I, II, III\} \)
2. Machine
The set of machines, \( M = \{A1, A2, B1, B2\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProcessingTime
A dictionary mapping (product, machine) to processing time per piece.
2. MachineCapacity
A dictionary mapping machine to its effective hours.
3. OperatingCostFull
A dictionary mapping machine to its operating cost at full capacity.
4. RawMaterialCost
A dictionary mapping product to its raw material cost per piece.
5. SalePrice
A dictionary mapping product to its sale price per piece.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQuantity
Integer variable, \( X_{p,m} \) for \( p \in P, m \in M \), representing the quantity of product \( p \) processed on machine \( m \).
2. TotalProduction
Integer variable, \( TotalX_{p} \) for \( p \in P \), representing the total quantity of product \( p \) produced.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Raw Material Cost - Total Variable Operating Cost
max: \sum_{p \in P} SalePrice[p] * TotalX_{p} - \sum_{p \in P} RawMaterialCost[p] * TotalX_{p} - \sum_{m \in M} \sum_{p \in P} (OperatingCostFull[m] / MachineCapacity[m]) * ProcessingTime[p,m] * X_{p,m}

Constraint:
1. Machine capacity constraints
For each machine, the total processing time cannot exceed its capacity.
\sum_{p \in P} ProcessingTime[p,m] * X_{p,m} \leq MachineCapacity[m], \forall m \in M
2. Production balance constraints
For each product, the total quantity produced must equal the sum of quantities processed in each stage (A and B).
TotalX_{p} = \sum_{m \in \{A1, A2\}} X_{p,m}, \forall p \in P
TotalX_{p} = \sum_{m \in \{B1, B2\}} X_{p,m}, \forall p \in P
3. Routing constraints
- Product I: Can be processed on any A equipment, but only on B1. \( X_{I,B2} = 0 \)
- Product II: Can be processed on any A equipment, but only on B1. \( X_{II,B2} = 0 \)
- Product III: Can only be processed on A2 and B2. \( X_{III,A1} = 0, X_{III,B1} = 0 \)
4. Non-negativity
\( X_{p,m} \geq 0, \forall p \in P, m \in M \)
\( TotalX_{p} \geq 0, \forall p \in P \)
