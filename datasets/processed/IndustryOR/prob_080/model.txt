Set:
1. Cars
The set of cars, \( C = \{1, 2, ..., 15\} \)
2. Sides
The set of sides of the street, \( S = \{1, 2\} \)

Parameter:
1. CarLengths
The length of each car, \( \lambda_i \).
[4, 4.5, 5, 4.1, 2.4, 5.2, 3.7, 3.5, 3.2, 4.5, 2.3, 3.3, 3.8, 4.6, 3]

Decision variable:
1. Assign
Binary variable, \( x_{is} \), is 1 if car \( i \) is parked on side \( s \), 0 otherwise.
2. MaxSideLength
Continuous variable, \( L_{max} \), representing the maximum length occupied on either side.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum length occupied on either side of the street.
min: \( L_{max} \)

Constraint:
1. Car Assignment
Each car must be assigned to exactly one side.
\sum_{s \in S} x_{is} = 1, \forall i \in C
2. Maximum Length Definition
The maximum length \( L_{max} \) must be greater than or equal to the total length of cars parked on each side.
\sum_{i \in C} \lambda_i * x_{is} \leq L_{max}, \forall s \in S
3. Side Length Limit
The total length of cars on any side must not exceed 30 meters.
\sum_{i \in C} \lambda_i * x_{is} \leq 30, \forall s \in S

Type:
Mixed-Integer, linear, linear
