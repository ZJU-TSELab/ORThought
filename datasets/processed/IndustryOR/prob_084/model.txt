# Model description for prob_084
Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{X, Y\} \).

Parameter:
1. MachineTime
[13, 19] # Machine time in minutes required per unit for each product.
2. CraftsmanTime
[20, 29] # Craftsman time in minutes required per unit for each product.
3. AvailableMachineTime
2400 # Total available machine time in minutes (40 hours * 60 min/hr).
4. AvailableCraftsmanTime
2100 # Total available craftsman time in minutes (35 hours * 60 min/hr).
5. Revenue
[20, 30] # Revenue in £ per unit for each product.
6. MachineCostPerHour
10 # Cost in £ per hour for machine time.
7. CraftsmanCostPerHour
2 # Cost in £ per hour for craftsman time.
8. MinProductionX
10 # Minimum number of units of product X to be produced.

Derived Parameter:
1. ProfitPerUnit
The profit for each product is calculated as Revenue - (MachineTime * MachineCost) - (CraftsmanTime * CraftsmanCost).
- Profit_X = 20 - (13/60 * 10) - (20/60 * 2) = 20 - 2.167 - 0.667 = 17.166
- Profit_Y = 30 - (19/60 * 10) - (29/60 * 2) = 30 - 3.167 - 0.967 = 25.866

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( n_p \) for all \( p \in P \), representing the number of units of product \( p \) to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total weekly profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P} \text{ProfitPerUnit}[p] * n_p

Constraint:
1. Machine Time Limit
The total machine time used cannot exceed the available time.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{MachineTime}[p] * n_p \leq \text{AvailableMachineTime}
2. Craftsman Time Limit
The total craftsman time used cannot exceed the available time.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{CraftsmanTime}[p] * n_p \leq \text{AvailableCraftsmanTime}
3. Contract Requirement
The production of product X must meet the contract.
n_X \geq \text{MinProductionX}
4. Non-negativity
n_p \geq 0, \forall p \in P

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
