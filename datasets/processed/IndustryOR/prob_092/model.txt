# Model description for prob_092
Set:
1. Products
The set of dairy products, \( P = \{A_1, A_2\} \).

Parameter:
1. Profit
[24, 16] # Profit in yuan per kg for each product.
2. MilkPerKg
[1/3, 1/4] # Barrels of milk required per kg of each product.
3. TimePerKg
[4, 2] # Labor hours required per kg of each product (12 hours / 3 kg for A1, 8 hours / 4 kg for A2).
4. MaxMilk
50 # Maximum daily supply of milk in barrels.
5. MaxLabor
480 # Maximum daily labor time in hours.
6. MaxA1
100 # Maximum daily production capacity for product A1 in kg.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Continuous variable, \( x_p \) for all \( p \in P \), representing the kilograms of product \( p \) to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total daily profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P} \text{Profit}[p] * x_p

Constraint:
1. Milk Supply
The total milk used cannot exceed the daily supply.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{MilkPerKg}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxMilk}
2. Labor Time
The total labor hours used cannot exceed the available time.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{TimePerKg}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxLabor}
3. A1 Capacity
The production of product A1 cannot exceed its daily capacity.
x_{A_1} \leq \text{MaxA1}
4. Non-negativity
x_p \geq 0, \forall p \in P

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
