Set:
1. Fruits
The set of fruit types, \( F = \{\text{Apples, Pears, Oranges, Lemons}\} \).

Parameter:
1. Profit
{'Apples': 2000, 'Pears': 1800, 'Oranges': 2200, 'Lemons': 3000} # Profit per acre for each fruit type.
2. TotalArea
120 # Total available farm area in acres.
3. BigM
120 # A large number, equal to the total area, used for linking continuous and binary variables.

Decision variable:
1. Acres
Continuous variable, \( x_f \) for \( f \in F \), represents the acres of land used to grow each fruit type.
2. GrowFruit
Binary variable, \( y_f \) for \( f \in F \), is 1 if fruit f is grown, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize: \( 2000x_{\text{Apples}} + 1800x_{\text{Pears}} + 2200x_{\text{Oranges}} + 3000x_{\text{Lemons}} \)

Constraint:
1. TotalArea
The total land used for all fruits cannot exceed the available area: \( \sum_{f \in F} x_f \le 120 \)
2. ApplesVsPears
The land for apples must be at least twice the land for pears: \( x_{\text{Apples}} \ge 2x_{\text{Pears}} \)
3. ApplesVsLemons
The land for apples must be at least three times the land for lemons: \( x_{\text{Apples}} \ge 3x_{\text{Lemons}} \)
4. OrangesVsLemons
The land for oranges must be exactly twice the land for lemons: \( x_{\text{Oranges}} = 2x_{\text{Lemons}} \)
5. MaxFruitTypes
At most two types of fruit can be grown: \( \sum_{f \in F} y_f \le 2 \)
6. LinkAcresToGrow
For each fruit \( f \in F \), if any amount of land is used for it, the corresponding binary variable must be 1. This is enforced using a Big-M constraint: \( x_f \le 120 \cdot y_f \).

Type:
Mixed-Integer, linear, linear
