Set:
1. Method
The set of transportation methods, \( M = \{Motorcycle, SmallTruck, LargeTruck\} \)

Parameter:
1. Pollution
{'Motorcycle': 40, 'SmallTruck': 70, 'LargeTruck': 100} # Units of pollution per trip
2. Capacity
{'Motorcycle': 10, 'SmallTruck': 20, 'LargeTruck': 50} # Units of product transported per trip
3. MinDemand
300 # Minimum total units of product to transport
4. MaxMotorcycleTrips
8 # Maximum number of motorcycle trips
5. MaxTotalTrips
20 # Maximum total number of trips

Decision variable:
1. Trips
Integer variable, \( x_{m} \) for \( m \in M \), representing the number of trips for each method.
2. UseMethod
Binary variable, \( y_{m} \) for \( m \in M \), indicating if method \( m \) is used.

Objective:
Minimize the total pollution.
min: \sum_{m \in M} Pollution[m] * x_{m}

Constraint:
1. Method selection
Exactly two transportation methods must be chosen.
\sum_{m \in M} y_{m} = 2
2. Demand satisfaction
The total amount of transported product must meet the minimum requirement.
\sum_{m \in M} Capacity[m] * x_{m} \geq MinDemand
3. Motorcycle trip limit
The number of motorcycle trips cannot exceed the limit.
\( x_{Motorcycle} \leq MaxMotorcycleTrips \)
4. Total trips limit
The total number of trips must not exceed the limit.
\sum_{m \in M} x_{m} \leq MaxTotalTrips
5. Linking trips and use variables
A method can only have trips if it is selected.
\( x_{m} \leq BigM * y_{m}, \forall m \in M \) (where BigM is a large number)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{m} \geq 0, \forall m \in M \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
