# Model description for prob_083
Set:
1. Candidates
The set of candidates, \( C = \{A, B, C, D, E\} \).

Parameter:
1. Salaries
[8100, 20000, 21000, 3000, 8000] # Salary requirement for each candidate.
2. Experience
[3, 10, 4, 3, 7] # Years of work experience for each candidate.
3. MaxHires
3 # Maximum number of new employees to hire.
4. MinHires
2 # Minimum number of new employees to hire.
5. Budget
35000 # Total budget for salaries.
6. MinExperience
12 # Minimum total years of work experience for the selected team.

Decision variable:
1. Hire
Binary variable, \( x_i \) for all \( i \in C \), is 1 if candidate \( i \) is hired, 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize the total salary paid to the hired candidates.
min: \sum_{i \in C} \text{Salaries}[i] * x_i

Constraint:
1. Maximum Hires
The total number of hired candidates cannot exceed the maximum limit.
\sum_{i \in C} x_i \leq \text{MaxHires}
2. Minimum Hires
The total number of hired candidates must be at least the minimum limit.
\sum_{i \in C} x_i \geq \text{MinHires}
3. Budget
The total salary paid cannot exceed the budget.
\sum_{i \in C} \text{Salaries}[i] * x_i \leq \text{Budget}
4. Qualification
At least one candidate with a Master's (B) or Doctoral (C) degree must be hired.
x_B + x_C \geq 1
5. Work Experience
The total work experience of the hired candidates must meet the minimum requirement.
\sum_{i \in C} \text{Experience}[i] * x_i \geq \text{MinExperience}
6. Skill Equivalence
At most one of candidates A and E can be hired.
x_A + x_E \leq 1
