Set:
1. Toy
The set of toys, \( T = \{robots, cars, blocks, dolls\} \)

Parameter:
1. Profit
[15, 8, 12, 5] # Profit for each toy
2. PlasticUsage
[30, 10, 20, 15] # Plastic units required for each toy
3. ElectronicsUsage
[8, 5, 3, 2] # Electronic components required for each toy
4. MaxPlastic
1200 # Maximum units of plastic available
5. MaxElectronics
800 # Maximum units of electronic components available

Decision variable:
1. Quantity
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of units of toy \( t \) to produce.
2. UseToy
Binary variable, \( y_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), indicating if toy \( t \) is manufactured.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{t \in T} Profit[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Plastic limit
\sum_{t \in T} PlasticUsage[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxPlastic
2. Electronics limit
\sum_{t \in T} ElectronicsUsage[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxElectronics
3. Conditional production: Robots and Dolls
If robots are manufactured, dolls cannot be.
\( y_{robots} + y_{dolls} \leq 1 \)
4. Conditional production: Cars and Blocks
If model cars are manufactured, building blocks must also be manufactured.
\( y_{blocks} \geq y_{cars} \)
5. Quantity relationship: Dolls and Cars
The number of dolls manufactured cannot exceed the number of model cars.
\( x_{dolls} \leq x_{cars} \)
6. Linking quantity and use variables
These constraints link the binary 'UseToy' variables to the integer 'Quantity' variables.
\( x_{t} \geq y_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \)
\( x_{t} \leq BigM * y_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \) (where BigM is a large number)
7. Non-negativity
\( x_{t} \geq 0, \forall t \in T \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
