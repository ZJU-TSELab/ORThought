Set:
1. Furnace
The set of furnaces, \( F = \{1, 2\} \)
2. Method
The set of steelmaking methods, \( M = \{1, 2\} \)

Parameter:
1. TimePerOp
[2, 3] # Hours per operation for each method
2. CostPerOp
[50, 70] # Fuel expense per operation for each method
3. SteelPerOp
10 # Tons of steel produced per operation
4. MinTotalSteel
30 # Minimum total tons of steel to be produced
5. MaxFurnaceHours
12 # Maximum hours available per furnace

Decision variable:
1. Operations
Continuous variable, \( x_{f,m} \) for \( f \in F, m \in M \), representing the number of times furnace \( f \) uses method \( m \).

Objective:
Minimize the total fuel expenses.
min: \sum_{f \in F} \sum_{m \in M} CostPerOp[m] * x_{f,m}

Constraint:
1. Time constraint for each furnace
The total time used by each furnace cannot exceed its available hours.
\sum_{m \in M} TimePerOp[m] * x_{f,m} \leq MaxFurnaceHours, \forall f \in F
2. Steel production constraint
The total amount of steel produced must meet the minimum requirement.
\sum_{f \in F} \sum_{m \in M} SteelPerOp * x_{f,m} \geq MinTotalSteel
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{f,m} \geq 0, \forall f \in F, m \in M \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
