Set:
1. TruckTypes
The set of truck types, \( T = \{A, B\} \).

Parameter:
1. RefrigeratedCapacity
[20, 30] # Refrigerated capacity in cubic meters for each truck type.
2. NonRefrigeratedCapacity
[40, 30] # Non-refrigerated capacity in cubic meters for each truck type.
3. RequiredRefrigerated
3000 # Total required refrigerated cargo in cubic meters.
4. RequiredNonRefrigerated
4000 # Total required non-refrigerated cargo in cubic meters.
5. RentalCost
[30, 40] # Rental cost in £ per kilometer for each truck type.

Decision variable:
1. NumTrucks
Integer variable, \( n_t \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of trucks of type \( t \) to rent.

Objective:
Minimize the total rental cost.
min: \sum_{t \in T} \text{RentalCost}[t] * n_t

Constraint:
1. Refrigerated Cargo
The total refrigerated capacity of the rented trucks must meet the requirement.
\sum_{t \in T} \text{RefrigeratedCapacity}[t] * n_t \geq \text{RequiredRefrigerated}
2. Non-Refrigerated Cargo
The total non-refrigerated capacity of the rented trucks must meet the requirement.
\sum_{t \in T} \text{NonRefrigeratedCapacity}[t] * n_t \geq \text{RequiredNonRefrigerated}
3. Non-negativity
n_t \geq 0, \forall t \in T

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
