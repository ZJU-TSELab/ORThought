Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{\text{Microwave, Heater}\} \).
2. Workshops
The set of workshops, \( W = \{A, B\} \).

Parameter:
1. ProcessingTime
[[2, 1], [1, 3]] # Hours required in workshop A and B for each product.
2. WorkshopCapacity
[250, 150] # Available monthly hours for workshop A and B.
3. WorkshopCost
[80, 20] # Cost per hour for workshop A and B.
4. InspectionSalesCost
[30, 50] # Inspection and sales cost per unit for each product.
5. MinSales
[80, 50] # Minimum monthly sales for each product.
6. MaxOvertimeA
20 # Maximum overtime hours for workshop A.
7. MaxInspectionSalesCost
5500 # Maximum total inspection and sales cost per month.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( x_p \) for \( p \in P \), represents the number of units of product p to produce.
2. OvertimeA
Continuous variable, \( o_A \), represents the overtime hours used in workshop A.

Objective:
Minimize: \( 80 \cdot (2x_{\text{Microwave}} + x_{\text{Heater}}) + 20 \cdot (x_{\text{Microwave}} + 3x_{\text{Heater}}) + 30x_{\text{Microwave}} + 50x_{\text{Heater}} \)
This simplifies to minimizing the total cost, which includes workshop operational costs and inspection/sales costs.

Constraint:
1. MinSalesMicrowave
At least 80 microwave ovens must be produced: \( x_{\text{Microwave}} \ge 80 \)
2. MinSalesHeater
At least 50 water heaters must be produced: \( x_{\text{Heater}} \ge 50 \)
3. WorkshopA_Utilization
The hours used in workshop A must equal its regular capacity plus any overtime: \( 2x_{\text{Microwave}} + x_{\text{Heater}} = 250 + o_A \)
4. WorkshopB_Utilization
The hours used in workshop B must equal its capacity (assuming it must be fully utilized): \( x_{\text{Microwave}} + 3x_{\text{Heater}} = 150 \)
5. OvertimeA_Limit
Overtime in workshop A cannot exceed 20 hours: \( o_A \le 20 \)
6. InspectionSalesCostLimit
Total inspection and sales costs must not exceed 5500: \( 30x_{\text{Microwave}} + 50x_{\text{Heater}} \le 5500 \)
