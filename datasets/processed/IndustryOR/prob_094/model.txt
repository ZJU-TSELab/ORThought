Set:
1. Weeks
The set of weeks, \( W = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).

Parameter:
1. Demand
[15, 25, 35, 25] # Demand in 1000s of boxes for each week.
2. ProductionCapacity
[30, 40, 45, 20] # Production capacity in 1000s of boxes for each week.
3. ProductionCost
[5.0, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5] # Production cost in 1000s of yuan per 1000 boxes for each week.
4. StorageCost
0.2 # Storage cost in 1000s of yuan per 1000 boxes per week.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Continuous variable, \( p_t \) for all \( t \in W \), representing the quantity (in 1000s of boxes) to produce in week \( t \).
2. InventoryQty
Continuous variable, \( i_t \) for all \( t \in W \), representing the inventory (in 1000s of boxes) at the end of week \( t \).

Objective:
Minimize the total cost, which is the sum of production costs and storage costs over the four weeks.
min: \sum_{t \in W} (\text{ProductionCost}[t] * p_t + \text{StorageCost} * i_t)

Constraint:
1. Inventory Balance
The inventory at the end of a week is the inventory from the previous week plus production, minus the current week's demand.
i_t = i_{t-1} + p_t - \text{Demand}[t], \forall t \in W (with \( i_0 = 0 \))
- Week 1: i_1 = p_1 - 15
- Week 2: i_2 = i_1 + p_2 - 25
- Week 3: i_3 = i_2 + p_3 - 35
- Week 4: i_4 = i_3 + p_4 - 25
2. Production Capacity
The production in each week cannot exceed the capacity for that week.
p_t \leq \text{ProductionCapacity}[t], \forall t \in W
3. Non-negativity
p_t \geq 0, i_t \geq 0, \forall t \in W
