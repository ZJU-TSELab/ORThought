Set:
1. Workers
The set of workers, \( W = \{I, II, III, IV, V\} \)
2. Tasks
The set of tasks, \( T = \{A, B, C, D\} \)

Parameter:
1. TimeRequired
A 5x4 matrix representing the hours required for each worker to complete each task.
   - I: [9, 4, 3, 7]
   - II: [4, 6, 5, 6]
   - III: [5, 4, 7, 5]
   - IV: [7, 5, 2, 3]
   - V: [10, 6, 7, 4]
2. WorkersToSelect
4 # The number of workers to be selected for the tasks.

Decision variable:
1. Assignment
Binary variable, \( x_{w,t} \), equals 1 if worker \( w \) is assigned to task \( t \), and 0 otherwise.
2. WorkerSelected
Binary variable, \( y_w \), equals 1 if worker \( w \) is selected, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize the total working hours.
min: \(\sum_{w \in W} \sum_{t \in T} TimeRequired_{w,t} \cdot x_{w,t}\)

Constraint:
1. Task Assignment
Each task must be assigned to exactly one worker.
\(\sum_{w \in W} x_{w,t} = 1, \forall t \in T\)
2. Worker Task Limit
A worker can be assigned to at most one task.
\(\sum_{t \in T} x_{w,t} \leq y_w, \forall w \in W\)
3. Worker Selection
Exactly 4 workers must be selected.
\(\sum_{w \in W} y_w = WorkersToSelect\)
4. Assignment Logic
A task can only be assigned to a selected worker.
\(x_{w,t} \leq y_w, \forall w \in W, t \in T\)
