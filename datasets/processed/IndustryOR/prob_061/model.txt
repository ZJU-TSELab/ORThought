Set:
1. Restaurants
The set of restaurants available for purchase, \( R = \{A, B, C, D\} \).

Parameter:
1. AnnualRevenue
[15000, 40000, 30000, 50000] # Annual revenue for each restaurant.
2. PurchaseCost
[1.6, 2.5, 1.8, 3.0] # Purchase cost in millions for each restaurant.
3. Budget
6 # Total investment budget in millions.

Decision variable:
1. PurchaseRestaurant
Binary variable, \( y_r \) for \( r \in R \), is 1 if restaurant r is purchased, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize: \( 15000y_A + 40000y_B + 30000y_C + 50000y_D \)

Constraint:
1. BudgetConstraint
The total cost of purchased restaurants cannot exceed the budget: \( 1.6y_A + 2.5y_B + 1.8y_C + 3.0y_D \le 6 \)
2. MutualExclusion
If Restaurant D is purchased, Restaurant A cannot be purchased: \( y_A + y_D \le 1 \)

Type:
