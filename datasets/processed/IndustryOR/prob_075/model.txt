Set:
1. Quarters
The set of quarters in a year, \( T = \{\text{Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn}\} \).

Parameter:
1. PurchasePrice
[410, 430, 460, 450] # Purchase price in 10,000 yuan per 10,000 m³.
2. SalePrice
[425, 440, 465, 455] # Sale price in 10,000 yuan per 10,000 m³.
3. MaxSalesVolume
[100, 140, 200, 160] # Estimated maximum sales volume in 10,000 m³.
4. WarehouseCapacity
20 # Maximum warehouse capacity in 10,000 m³.
5. StorageCost
170 # Storage cost in 10,000 yuan per 10,000 m³ per quarter.
6. InitialInventory
0 # Initial inventory at the beginning of Winter.

Decision variable:
1. BuyVolume
Continuous variable, \( b_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the volume of timber (in 10,000 m³) purchased at the beginning of quarter t.
2. SellVolume
Continuous variable, \( s_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the volume of timber (in 10,000 m³) sold during quarter t.
3. InventoryVolume
Continuous variable, \( i_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the volume of timber (in 10,000 m³) stored at the end of quarter t.

Objective:
Maximize: \( \sum_{t \in T} (\text{SalePrice}_t \cdot s_t - \text{PurchasePrice}_t \cdot b_t - \text{StorageCost} \cdot i_t) \)

Constraint:
1. InventoryBalance
For each quarter \( t \in T \), the ending inventory is the previous inventory plus purchases minus sales: \( i_t = i_{t-1} + b_t - s_t \), where \( i_0 = 0 \).
2. WarehouseCapacity
For each quarter \( t \in T \), the ending inventory cannot exceed the warehouse capacity: \( i_t \le 20 \).
3. MaxSales
For each quarter \( t \in T \), the sales volume cannot exceed the estimated maximum: \( s_t \le \text{MaxSalesVolume}_t \).
4. SalesAvailability
For each quarter \( t \in T \), the sales volume cannot exceed the timber available (previous inventory + current purchases): \( s_t \le i_{t-1} + b_t \).
5. FinalInventory
All inventory must be sold by the end of Autumn: \( i_{\text{Autumn}} = 0 \).
