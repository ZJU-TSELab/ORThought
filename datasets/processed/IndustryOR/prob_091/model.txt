Set:
1. BusTypes
The set of bus types, \( T = \{\text{LargeBus, Minibus}\} \).

Parameter:
1. NumStudents
400 # Total number of students to transport.
2. Capacity
[50, 40] # Seating capacity for each bus type.
3. Availability
[10, 8] # Number of available vehicles for each bus type.
4. RentalCost
[800, 600] # Rental cost in £ for each bus type.
5. AvailableDrivers
9 # Total number of available drivers.

Decision variable:
1. NumVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_t \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of vehicles of type \( t \) to rent.

Objective:
Minimize the total rental cost.
min: \sum_{t \in T} \text{RentalCost}[t] * x_t

Constraint:
1. Student Capacity
The total seating capacity of the rented vehicles must be sufficient for all students.
\sum_{t \in T} \text{Capacity}[t] * x_t \geq \text{NumStudents}
2. Driver Availability
The total number of rented vehicles cannot exceed the number of available drivers.
\sum_{t \in T} x_t \leq \text{AvailableDrivers}
3. Vehicle Availability
The number of rented vehicles of each type cannot exceed the number available.
x_t \leq \text{Availability}[t], \forall t \in T
4. Non-negativity
x_t \geq 0, \forall t \in T

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
