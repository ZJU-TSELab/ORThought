Set:
1. Parts
The set of key target parts, \( P = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \)
2. BombTypes
The set of bomb types, \( B = \{Heavy, Light\} \)

Parameter:
1. Distance
[450, 480, 540, 600] # Distance in km from the airport to each part.
2. ProbDestroyHeavy
[0.10, 0.20, 0.15, 0.25] # Destruction probability for each part by a heavy bomb.
3. ProbDestroyLight
[0.08, 0.16, 0.12, 0.20] # Destruction probability for each part by a light bomb.
4. MaxFuel
48000 # Maximum fuel available in liters.
5. MaxHeavyBombs
48 # Maximum number of heavy bombs available.
6. MaxLightBombs
32 # Maximum number of light bombs available.
7. EffLoadedHeavy
2.0 # Fuel efficiency for heavy bombs (km/liter).
8. EffLoadedLight
3.0 # Fuel efficiency for light bombs (km/liter).
9. EffEmpty
4.0 # Fuel efficiency for empty return trip (km/liter).
10. FuelTakeoffLanding
100 # Fuel for takeoff and landing per trip (liters).

Decision variable:
1. BombsAssigned
Integer variable, \( x_{p,b} \), the number of bombs of type \( b \) assigned to part \( p \).

Objective:
Maximize the probability of destroying at least one part. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the logarithms of the probabilities of *not* destroying each part.
min: \(\sum_{p \in P} \sum_{b \in B} x_{p,b} \cdot \ln(1 - ProbDestroy_{p,b})\)

Constraint:
1. Fuel Limit
Total fuel consumed cannot exceed the maximum available.
\(\sum_{p \in P} \sum_{b \in B} FuelPerTrip_{p,b} \cdot x_{p,b} \leq MaxFuel\)
   where FuelPerTrip is calculated as: \( (Distance_p / EffLoaded_b) + (Distance_p / EffEmpty) + FuelTakeoffLanding \)
2. Heavy Bomb Limit
\(\sum_{p \in P} x_{p, Heavy} \leq MaxHeavyBombs\)
3. Light Bomb Limit
\(\sum_{p \in P} x_{p, Light} \leq MaxLightBombs\)
4. Non-negativity
\(x_{p,b} \geq 0, \forall p \in P, b \in B\)

Integer, non-linear, linear
