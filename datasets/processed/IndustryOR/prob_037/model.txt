Set:
1. Product
The set of products, \( P = \{0, 1, 2\} \)
2. Machine
The set of machines, \( M = \{0, 1, 2\} \)
3. Position
The set of sequence positions, \( K = \{0, 1, 2\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProcessingTime
A matrix \( t_{p,m} \) where \( p \in P, m \in M \), representing the time to process product \( p \) on machine \( m \).

Decision variable:
1. Assignment
Binary variable, \( z_{p,k} \), which is 1 if product \( p \) is in the \( k \)-th sequence position, and 0 otherwise.
2. StartTime
Continuous variable, \( S_{k,m} \), representing the start time of the product in the \( k \)-th sequence position on machine \( m \).
3. Makespan
Continuous variable, \( C_{max} \), representing the total processing cycle.

Objective:
Minimize the total processing cycle (makespan).
min: \( C_{max} \)

Constraint:
1. Assignment constraints
Each product must be assigned to exactly one position, and each position must be filled by exactly one product.
\sum_{k \in K} z_{p,k} = 1, \forall p \in P
\sum_{p \in P} z_{p,k} = 1, \forall k \in K
2. Scheduling constraints
- A product can only start on the next machine after it has finished on the previous one.
\( S_{k,m} \geq S_{k,m-1} + \sum_{p \in P} z_{p,k} \cdot t_{p,m-1}, \forall k \in K, m \in M, m > 0 \)
- A machine can only start processing the next product in the sequence after it has finished the previous one.
\( S_{k,m} \geq S_{k-1,m} + \sum_{p \in P} z_{p,k-1} \cdot t_{p,m}, \forall k \in K, k > 0, m \in M \)
3. Makespan definition
The makespan is the completion time of the last product on the last machine.
\( C_{max} \geq S_{\text{last_pos}, \text{last_mach}} + \sum_{p \in P} z_{p, \text{last_pos}} \cdot t_{p, \text{last_mach}} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( S_{k,m} \geq 0, \forall k \in K, m \in M \)
\( C_{max} \geq 0 \)

Type:
Mixed-Integer, linear, linear
MILP
