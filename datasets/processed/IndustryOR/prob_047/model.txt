Set:
1. Products
The set of microcomputer models, \( P = \{A, B\} \).

Parameter:
1. ProcessTime
{'I': {'A': 4, 'B': 6}, 'II': {'A': 3, 'B': 2}} # Processing time in hours per unit for each model on each process.
2. MaxCapacity
{'I': 150, 'II': 70} # Maximum weekly processing capacity in hours for each process.
3. Profit
{'A': 300, 'B': 450} # Sales profit in yuan per unit for each model.
4. MinProduction
{'A': 10, 'B': 15} # Minimum weekly production quantity for each model.
5. MinProfit
10000 # Minimum total weekly profit in yuan.
6. OvertimeProfitReduction
{'A': 20, 'B': 25} # Profit reduction per unit for products made during overtime.
7. MaxOvertime
30 # Maximum overtime for Process II in hours per week.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Continuous variable, \( x_p \) for \( p \in P \), represents the total number of units of model p produced per week.
2. OvertimeQty
Continuous variable, \( x'_{p} \) for \( p \in P \), represents the number of units of model p produced during overtime in Process II.

Objective:
Maximize: \( (300 \cdot x_A - 20 \cdot x'_{A}) + (450 \cdot x_B - 25 \cdot x'_{B}) \)

Constraint:
1. MinProduction
The production quantity for each model must meet the minimum requirement:
- \( x_A \ge 10 \)
- \( x_B \ge 15 \)
2. ProcessICapacity
The total processing time for Process I must be exactly its maximum capacity: \( 4x_A + 6x_B = 150 \)
3. ProcessIIRegularCapacity
The total processing time for Process II during regular hours cannot exceed its capacity: \( 3x_A + 2x_B \le 70 + (3x'_{A} + 2x'_{B}) \)
4. OvertimeLimit
The total overtime hours used in Process II cannot exceed the maximum allowed: \( 3x'_{A} + 2x'_{B} \le 30 \)
5. OvertimeQtyLink
The quantity produced during overtime cannot exceed the total quantity produced for each model:
- \( x'_{A} \le x_A \)
- \( x'_{B} \le x_B \)
6. MinProfit
The total profit must not be less than the target: \( (300 \cdot x_A - 20 \cdot x'_{A}) + (450 \cdot x_B - 25 \cdot x'_{B}) \ge 10000 \)
