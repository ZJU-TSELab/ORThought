Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{\text{Liquid}, \text{Solid}\} \).
2. Machines
The set of machines, \( M = \{1, 2\} \).

Parameter:
1. MachineTime
A 2x2 matrix representing the time in minutes required on each machine for each product.
   - Liquid: [50, 30] for Machine 1, Machine 2
   - Solid: [24, 33] for Machine 1, Machine 2
2. AvailableTime
[2400, 2100] # Available time in minutes for Machine 1 and Machine 2.
3. InitialInventory
[30, 90] # Initial inventory in units for Liquid and Solid fertilizer.
4. Demand
[75, 95] # Demand in units for Liquid and Solid fertilizer.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( p_i \) for all \( i \in P \), representing the number of units of product \( i \) to produce.
2. EndingInventory
Integer variable, \( e_i \) for all \( i \in P \), representing the number of units of product \( i \) in inventory at the end of the week.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of units in inventory at the end of the week.
max: \sum_{i \in P} e_i

Constraint:
1. Machine Time
The total time used on each machine cannot exceed its availability.
\sum_{i \in P} \text{MachineTime}[i,j] * p_i \leq \text{AvailableTime}[j], \forall j \in M
2. Inventory Balance
The ending inventory is the initial inventory plus production minus demand.
e_i = \text{InitialInventory}[i] + p_i - \text{Demand}[i], \forall i \in P
3. Non-negativity
p_i \geq 0, e_i \geq 0, \forall i \in P

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
