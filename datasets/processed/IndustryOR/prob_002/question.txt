For the manufacturing industry, formulating an appropriate product production plan and human resource management scheme is very important for reducing operating costs, inventory costs, stockout costs, and labor costs. Specifically, for products with large demand fluctuations, companies need to accurately predict demand and formulate corresponding production plans. A certain company produces a type of foldable table, the raw material cost for each product is 90 Yuan, and the labor hours are 5 hours. The unit price of the product is 300 Yuan. The company has 1,000 workers at the beginning of January and holds an inventory of 15,000 units. The regular hourly wage for workers is 30 Yuan, with a normal daily working time of 8 hours. Any extra working time is considered overtime, with an overtime hourly wage of 40 Yuan. The number of working days per month is calculated as 20 days. Suppose the company's available production machines are sufficient, and the capacity is not limited by machine hours. Each worker's overtime hours do not exceed 20 hours per month. Holding inventory will generate corresponding inventory costs. If a stockout occurs due to insufficient capacity, there will be certain stockout costs. Additionally, the company can also make up for the stockout part through outsourcing. The outsourcing cost per product, monthly inventory cost, and monthly stockout cost are 200 Yuan, 15 Yuan, and 35 Yuan, respectively. The company's employees are temporary workers, and the company can flexibly decide the number of people to hire and fire each month. The cost of hiring and firing a single employee is 5,000 Yuan and 8,000 Yuan, respectively. Suppose the company has used the existing forecasting model to predict the demand from January to June, as shown in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1: Demand Forecast

| Month | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Demand Forecast | 20000 | 40000 | 42000 | 35000 | 19000 | 18500 |

Please formulate a production plan, worker work schedule, and hire/fire plan for the company to maximize the total net profit over 6 months while ensuring that the company holds at least 10,000 units of products by the end of June.
