Set:
1. Products
The set of main products, \( P = \{A, B\} \).
2. Processes
The set of chemical processes, \( C = \{1, 2\} \).

Parameter:
1. ProcessTime
[[2, 3], [3, 4]] # Hours required for products A and B in processes 1 and 2.
2. AvailableTime
[16, 24] # Available hours for process 1 and 2.
3. ProductProfit
[4, 10] # Profit per unit for products A and B.
4. ByproductProfit
3 # Profit per unit for by-product C.
5. DisposalCost
2 # Disposal cost per unit for by-product C.
6. MaxByproductSale
5 # Maximum units of by-product C that can be sold.

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQtyA
Continuous variable, \( x_A \), represents the units of product A to produce.
2. ProductionQtyB
Continuous variable, \( x_B \), represents the units of product B to produce.
3. ByproductSold
Continuous variable, \( s_C \), represents the units of by-product C sold.
4. ByproductDisposed
Continuous variable, \( d_C \), represents the units of by-product C disposed of.

Objective:
Maximize: \( 4x_A + 10x_B + 3s_C - 2d_C \)

Constraint:
1. Process1_Time
The total time used in process 1 cannot exceed the available time: \( 2x_A + 3x_B \le 16 \)
2. Process2_Time
The total time used in process 2 cannot exceed the available time: \( 3x_A + 4x_B \le 24 \)
3. ByproductBalance
The total by-product C generated from producing B must equal the amount sold plus the amount disposed of: \( 2x_B = s_C + d_C \)
4. MaxSaleOfC
The amount of by-product C sold cannot exceed 5 units: \( s_C \le 5 \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
