Set:
1. Item
The set of items to be inherited, \( I \).

Parameter:
1. Value
A dictionary mapping each item to its monetary value.
2. TotalValue
The sum of the values of all items.

Decision variable:
1. Assignment
Binary variable, \( y_{i} \) for each item \( i \in I \). \( y_{i} = 1 \) if the item is assigned to the first son, \( 0 \) if assigned to the second son.
2. Difference
Continuous variable, \( d \), representing the absolute difference in value between the two shares.

Objective:
Minimize the difference in value between the two shares.
min: d

Constraint:
1. Absolute difference linearization
Let \( V_1 \) be the total value assigned to the first son and \( V_2 \) to the second.
\( V_1 = \sum_{i \in I} Value[i] * y_{i} \)
\( V_2 = TotalValue - V_1 \)
The difference is \( |V_1 - V_2| = |V_1 - (TotalValue - V_1)| = |2V_1 - TotalValue| \).
We want to minimize \( d = |2 \sum_{i \in I} Value[i] * y_{i} - TotalValue| \).
This is linearized as:
\( 2 \sum_{i \in I} Value[i] * y_{i} - TotalValue \leq d \)
\( -(2 \sum_{i \in I} Value[i] * y_{i} - TotalValue) \leq d \)
2. Dogs must stay together
The two dogs must be assigned to the same son.
\( y_{dog1} = y_{dog2} \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
