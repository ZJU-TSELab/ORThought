Set:
1. Activities
The set of project activities, \( A = \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\} \).

Parameter:
1. Duration
[4, 3, 5, 2, 10, 10, 1] # Duration in days for each activity.
2. CostWorkPerDay
1000 # Cost of work per day in Euros.
3. CostMachinePerDay
5000 # Rental cost of the special machine per day.

Decision variable:
1. StartTime
Integer variable, \( S_a \) for \( a \in A \), represents the start time of each activity.
2. Makespan
Integer variable, \( M \), represents the total project duration.
3. MachineRentalDuration
Integer variable, \( R \), represents the total duration for which the machine is rented.

Objective:
Minimize: \( 1000 \cdot M + 5000 \cdot R \)

Constraint:
1. PrecedenceConstraints
The start time of a successor activity must be greater than or equal to the completion time of its predecessor(s).
- \( S_G \ge S_A + 4 \)
- \( S_D \ge S_A + 4 \)
- \( S_F \ge S_E + 10 \)
- \( S_F \ge S_G + 1 \)
- \( S_C \ge S_D + 2 \)
- \( S_C \ge S_F + 10 \)
- \( S_B \ge S_F + 10 \)
2. MakespanDefinition
The makespan must be greater than or equal to the completion time of all activities.
- \( M \ge S_a + \text{Duration}_a \) for all \( a \in A \).
3. MachineRentalDurationDefinition
The machine rental duration is the time from the start of activity A to the end of activity B.
- \( R \ge (S_B + 3) - S_A \)
