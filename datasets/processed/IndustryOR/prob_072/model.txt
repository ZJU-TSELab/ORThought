Set:
1. Children
The set of children, \( C = \{\text{Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Ella}\} \).

Parameter:
1. Cost
[1000, 900, 600, 500, 700] # Cost to take each child.
2. MaxChildren
3 # Maximum number of children to take.
3. MinChildren
2 # Minimum number of children to take.

Decision variable:
1. TakeChild
Binary variable, \( x_c \) for \( c \in C \), is 1 if child c is taken, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize: \( 1000x_{\text{Alice}} + 900x_{\text{Bob}} + 600x_{\text{Charlie}} + 500x_{\text{Diana}} + 700x_{\text{Ella}} \)

Constraint:
1. MaxChildrenConstraint
At most 3 children can be taken: \( \sum_{c \in C} x_c \le 3 \)
2. MinChildrenConstraint
At least 2 children must be taken: \( \sum_{c \in C} x_c \ge 2 \)
3. MustTakeBob
Bob is definitely taken: \( x_{\text{Bob}} = 1 \)
4. AliceDianaExclusion
If Alice is taken, Diana is not: \( x_{\text{Alice}} + x_{\text{Diana}} \le 1 \)
5. BobCharlieExclusion
If Bob is taken, Charlie is not. Since Bob must be taken, this implies Charlie is not taken: \( x_{\text{Charlie}} = 0 \)
6. CharlieDianaImplication
If Charlie is taken, Diana must also be taken: \( x_{\text{Charlie}} \le x_{\text{Diana}} \)
7. DianaEllaImplication
If Diana is taken, Ella must also be taken: \( x_{\text{Diana}} \le x_{\text{Ella}} \)
