Set:
1. Properties
The set of commercial real estate properties, \( P = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).

Parameter:
1. AnnualIncome
[12500, 35000, 23000, 100000] # Annual income from each property.
2. PurchaseCost
[1.5, 2.1, 2.3, 4.2] # Purchase cost in millions for each property.
3. Budget
7 # Total investment budget in millions.

Decision variable:
1. PurchaseProperty
Binary variable, \( y_p \) for \( p \in P \), is 1 if property p is purchased, and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Maximize: \( 12500y_1 + 35000y_2 + 23000y_3 + 100000y_4 \)

Constraint:
1. BudgetConstraint
The total cost of purchased properties cannot exceed the budget: \( 1.5y_1 + 2.1y_2 + 2.3y_3 + 4.2y_4 \le 7 \)
2. MutualExclusion
If Property 4 is purchased, Property 3 cannot be purchased: \( y_3 + y_4 \le 1 \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
