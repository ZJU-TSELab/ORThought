Set:
1. Locations
The set of potential store locations and residential areas to be covered, \( L = \{A, B, ..., L\} \)

Parameter:
1. Coverage
A matrix or dictionary indicating which locations can cover which residential areas. For each location \( l \in L \), there is a set of areas \( C_l \subseteq L \) that it covers.
   - A covers {A, C, E, G, H, I}
   - B covers {B, H, I}
   - C covers {A, C, G, H, I}
   - D covers {D, J}
   - E covers {A, E, G}
   - F covers {F, J, K}
   - G covers {A, C, E, G}
   - H covers {A, B, C, H, I}
   - I covers {A, B, C, H, I}
   - J covers {D, F, J, K, L}
   - K covers {F, J, K, L}
   - L covers {J, K, L}

Decision variable:
1. BuildStore
Binary variable, \( x_l \), equals 1 if a store is built at location \( l \in L \), and 0 otherwise.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of stores built.
min: \(\sum_{l \in L} x_l\)

Constraint:
1. Coverage Requirement
Each residential area must be covered by at least one store.
\(\sum_{l \in L : a \in C_l} x_l \geq 1, \forall a \in L\)
(For each area \(a\), sum over all locations \(l\) that can cover \(a\)).
