Set:
1. Good
The set of goods, \( G = \{A, B, C, D, E\} \)
2. Container
A set of potential containers, \( K = \{1, ..., N\} \), where N is a sufficiently large number.

Parameter:
1. Demand
{'A': 120, 'B': 90, 'C': 300, 'D': 90, 'E': 120} # Required quantity for each good
2. Weight
{'A': 0.5, 'B': 1.0, 'C': 0.4, 'D': 0.6, 'E': 0.65} # Weight per unit for each good
3. MaxContainerWeight
60 # Maximum weight capacity of a container (tons)
4. MinContainerWeight
18 # Minimum weight to be loaded in a used container (tons)
5. MinDPerContainer
12 # Minimum units of good D to be loaded in a used container.

Decision variable:
1. QuantityLoaded
Continuous variable, \( x_{g,k} \) for \( g \in G, k \in K \), representing the quantity of good \( g \) loaded into container \( k \).
2. UseContainer
Binary variable, \( y_{k} \) for \( k \in K \), indicating if container \( k \) is used.
3. LoadA
Binary variable, \( z_{A,k} \) for \( k \in K \), indicating if good A is loaded into container \( k \).

Objective:
Minimize the total number of containers used.
min: \sum_{k \in K} y_{k}

Constraint:
1. Demand satisfaction
For each good, the total quantity loaded across all containers must meet the demand.
\sum_{k \in K} x_{g,k} \geq Demand[g], \forall g \in G
2. Container capacity
The total weight in each container cannot exceed its maximum capacity.
\sum_{g \in G} Weight[g] * x_{g,k} \leq MaxContainerWeight * y_{k}, \forall k \in K
3. Minimum container load
If a container is used, it must be loaded with a minimum total weight.
\sum_{g \in G} Weight[g] * x_{g,k} \geq MinContainerWeight * y_{k}, \forall k \in K
4. Minimum D per container
If a container is used, it must contain at least 12 units of good D.
\( x_{D,k} \geq MinDPerContainer * y_{k}, \forall k \in K \)
5. Conditional loading of A and C
If good A is loaded in a container, at least one unit of C must also be loaded in that container.
\( x_{A,k} \leq BigM * z_{A,k}, \forall k \in K \)
\( x_{C,k} \geq z_{A,k}, \forall k \in K \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{g,k} \geq 0, \forall g \in G, k \in K \)
