Set:
1. Months
The set of months for the planning horizon, \( T = \{\text{July, August, ..., December}\} \).

Parameter:
1. PurchasePrice
[28, 24, 25, 27, 23, 23] # Purchase price per unit for each month \( p_t \).
2. SellingPrice
[29, 24, 26, 28, 22, 25] # Selling price per unit for each month \( s_t \).
3. WarehouseCapacity
500 # Maximum warehouse capacity in units.
4. InitialInventory
200 # Inventory at the end of June (start of July).

Decision variable:
1. Buy
Integer variable, \( b_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the quantity purchased at the beginning of month t.
2. Sell
Integer variable, \( s_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the quantity sold during month t.
3. Inventory
Integer variable, \( i_t \) for \( t \in T \), represents the inventory at the end of month t.

Objective:
Maximize: \( \sum_{t \in T} (s_t \cdot \text{SellingPrice}_t - b_t \cdot \text{PurchasePrice}_t) \)

Constraint:
1. InventoryBalance
For each month \( t \in T \), the ending inventory is the starting inventory plus purchases minus sales: \( i_t = i_{t-1} + b_t - s_t \), where \( i_0 \) is the initial inventory.
2. WarehouseCapacity
For each month \( t \in T \), the inventory level after purchasing must not exceed the warehouse capacity: \( i_{t-1} + b_t \le 500 \).
3. SalesLimit
For each month \( t \in T \), the quantity sold cannot exceed the available inventory after purchase: \( s_t \le i_{t-1} + b_t \).
