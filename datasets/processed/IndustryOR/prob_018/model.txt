Set:
1. Manufacturer
The set of manufacturers, \( M = \{A, B, C\} \)

Parameter:
1. CostPerChair
[50, 45, 40] # Cost per chair for each manufacturer [A, B, C]
2. ChairsPerOrder
[15, 10, 10] # Number of chairs per order for each manufacturer [A, B, C]
3. MinTotalChairs
100 # Minimum total number of chairs to order
4. MaxTotalChairs
500 # Maximum total number of chairs to order

Decision variable:
1. Orders
Integer variable, \( x_{m} \) for all \( m \in M \), representing the number of orders from manufacturer \( m \).
2. UseManufacturer
Binary variable, \( y_{m} \) for \( m \in \{A, B\} \), indicating if any chairs are ordered from manufacturer \( m \).

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of the orders.
min: \sum_{m \in M} CostPerChair[m] * ChairsPerOrder[m] * x_{m}

Constraint:
1. Minimum total chairs constraint
\sum_{m \in M} ChairsPerOrder[m] * x_{m} \geq MinTotalChairs
2. Maximum total chairs constraint
\sum_{m \in M} ChairsPerOrder[m] * x_{m} \leq MaxTotalChairs
3. Conditional order from A to B
If chairs are ordered from A, then at least one order must be placed with B.
\( y_{A} = 1 \implies x_{B} \geq 1 \)
4. Conditional order from B to C
If chairs are ordered from B, then at least one order must be placed with C.
\( y_{B} = 1 \implies x_{C} \geq 1 \)
5. Linking orders and use variables
These constraints link the binary 'Use' variables to the integer 'Orders' variables.
\( x_{m} \geq y_{m} \) for \( m \in \{A, B\} \)
\( x_{m} \leq BigM * y_{m} \) for \( m \in \{A, B\} \) (where BigM is a large number)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{m} \geq 0, \forall m \in M \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
