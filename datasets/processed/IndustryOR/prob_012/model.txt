Set:
1. Crops
The set of crops to plant, \( C = \{\text{Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Sorghum}\} \)

Parameter:
1. ProfitPerAcre
[1500, 1200, 1800, 1600] # Profit per acre for each crop.
2. TotalLand
100 # Total acres of land available.

Decision variable:
1. AcresToPlant
Continuous variable, \( x_c \), the number of acres to allocate to each crop \( c \in C \).

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \(\sum_{c \in C} ProfitPerAcre_c \cdot x_c\)

Constraint:
1. Total Land Usage
The total acres planted cannot exceed the available land.
\(\sum_{c \in C} x_c \leq TotalLand\)
2. Corn-Wheat Ratio
The land for corn must be at least twice the land for wheat.
\(x_{Corn} \geq 2 \cdot x_{Wheat}\)
3. Soybean-Sorghum Ratio
The land for soybeans must be at least half the land for sorghum.
\(x_{Soybeans} \geq 0.5 \cdot x_{Sorghum}\)
4. Wheat-Sorghum Ratio
The land for wheat must be three times the land for sorghum.
\(x_{Wheat} = 3 \cdot x_{Sorghum}\)
5. Non-negativity
\(x_c \geq 0, \forall c \in C\)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
