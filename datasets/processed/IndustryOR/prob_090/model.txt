# Model description for prob_090
Set:
1. Products
The set of products, \( P = \{A, B\} \).

Parameter:
1. Profit
[3, 5] # Profit in £ per unit for each product.
2. AssemblyTime
[12, 25] # Assembly time in minutes per unit for each product.
3. MaxAssemblyTime
1800 # Maximum total assembly time in minutes per week (30 hours * 60 min/hr).

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( x_p \) for all \( p \in P \), representing the number of units of product \( p \) to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total weekly profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P} \text{Profit}[p] * x_p

Constraint:
1. Assembly Time
The total assembly time cannot exceed the maximum available time.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{AssemblyTime}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxAssemblyTime}
2. Technical Ratio
For every five units of product A, at least two units of product B must be produced. This can be written as \( x_B / x_A \geq 2/5 \), which is equivalent to \( 5x_B \geq 2x_A \).
2x_A - 5x_B \leq 0
3. Non-negativity
x_p \geq 0, \forall p \in P

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
