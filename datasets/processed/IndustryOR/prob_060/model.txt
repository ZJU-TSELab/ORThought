Set:
1. Devices
The set of available devices, \( D = \{A, B, C, D\} \).

Parameter:
1. PrepCost
[1000, 920, 800, 700] # Preparation completion cost for each device.
2. UnitProdCost
[20, 24, 16, 28] # Unit production cost on each device.
3. MaxCapacity
[900, 1000, 1200, 1600] # Maximum processing capacity of each device.
4. TotalDemand
2000 # Total number of units to be produced.

Decision variable:
1. UseDevice
Binary variable, \( y_d \) for \( d \in D \), is 1 if device d is used, and 0 otherwise.
2. ProductionQty
Integer variable, \( x_d \) for \( d \in D \), represents the number of units produced on device d.

Objective:
Minimize: \( \sum_{d \in D} (\text{PrepCost}_d \cdot y_d + \text{UnitProdCost}_d \cdot x_d) \)

Constraint:
1. DemandSatisfaction
The total number of units produced across all devices must equal the total demand: \( \sum_{d \in D} x_d = 2000 \)
2. CapacityConstraint
For each device \( d \in D \), the number of units produced cannot exceed its capacity. This is only possible if the device is used (Big-M formulation): \( x_d \le \text{MaxCapacity}_d \cdot y_d \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
