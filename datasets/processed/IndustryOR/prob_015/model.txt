Set:
1. Months
The set of months, \( M = \{1, 2, 3\} \)

Parameter:
1. PurchasePrice
[8, 6, 9] # Purchase price per unit in each month.
2. SellingPrice
[9, 8, 10] # Selling price per unit in each month.
3. WarehouseCapacity
500 # Maximum units the warehouse can store.
4. InitialInventory
200 # Units in stock at the end of the previous year.

Decision variable:
1. PurchaseQty
Integer variable, \( x_m \), the quantity to purchase in month \( m \).
2. SellQty
Integer variable, \( y_m \), the quantity to sell in month \( m \).
3. Inventory
Integer variable, \( s_m \), the inventory at the end of month \( m \).

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \(\sum_{m \in M} (SellingPrice_m \cdot y_m - PurchasePrice_m \cdot x_m)\)

Constraint:
1. Inventory Balance
\(s_m = s_{m-1} + x_m - y_m, \forall m \in M\) (where \(s_0 = InitialInventory\))
2. Warehouse Capacity (End of Month)
The inventory at the end of each month cannot exceed capacity.
\(s_m \leq WarehouseCapacity, \forall m \in M\)
3. Warehouse Capacity (After Purchase)
The inventory after purchasing cannot exceed capacity.
\(s_{m-1} + x_m \leq WarehouseCapacity, \forall m \in M\)
4. Sales Limit
The quantity sold cannot exceed the available inventory.
\(y_m \leq s_{m-1} + x_m, \forall m \in M\)
5. Non-negativity
All decision variables \(\geq 0\).

Type:
