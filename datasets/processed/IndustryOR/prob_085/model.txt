Set:
1. Products
The set of dog food products, \( P = \{\text{Meaties, Yummies}\} \).

Parameter:
1. GrainsPerPack
[2.0, 3.0] # Pounds of grains required per pack for each product.
2. MeatPerPack
[3.0, 1.5] # Pounds of meat required per pack for each product.
3. MaxGrains
400000 # Maximum pounds of grains available per month.
4. MaxMeat
300000 # Maximum pounds of meat available per month.
5. MaxMeatiesCapacity
90000 # Maximum production capacity for Meaties in packs per month.
6. SellingPrice
[2.80, 2.00] # Selling price in $ per pack for each product.
7. GrainCost
0.20 # Cost in $ per pound of grains.
8. MeatCost
0.50 # Cost in $ per pound of meat.
9. VariableCost
[0.25, 0.20] # Variable cost in $ per pack for mixing and packaging.

Derived Parameter:
1. ProfitPerPack
The profit for each product is calculated as SellingPrice - (GrainsPerPack * GrainCost) - (MeatPerPack * MeatCost) - VariableCost.
- Profit_Meaties = 2.80 - (2.0 * 0.20) - (3.0 * 0.50) - 0.25 = 2.80 - 0.40 - 1.50 - 0.25 = 0.65
- Profit_Yummies = 2.00 - (3.0 * 0.20) - (1.5 * 0.50) - 0.20 = 2.00 - 0.60 - 0.75 - 0.20 = 0.45

Decision variable:
1. ProductionQty
Continuous variable, \( x_p \) for all \( p \in P \), representing the number of packs of product \( p \) to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total monthly profit.
max: \sum_{p \in P} \text{ProfitPerPack}[p] * x_p

Constraint:
1. Grain Availability
The total amount of grains used cannot exceed the available quantity.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{GrainsPerPack}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxGrains}
2. Meat Availability
The total amount of meat used cannot exceed the available quantity.
\sum_{p \in P} \text{MeatPerPack}[p] * x_p \leq \text{MaxMeat}
3. Meaties Capacity
The production of Meaties cannot exceed its machine capacity.
x_{\text{Meaties}} \leq \text{MaxMeatiesCapacity}
4. Non-negativity
x_p \geq 0, \forall p \in P

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
