Set:
1. Warehouse
The set of warehouses, \( W = \{A, B\} \)
2. Material
The set of raw materials, \( M = \{A, B, C\} \)

Parameter:
1. FreightCost
[200, 160] # Freight cost per truck from each warehouse
2. MaterialPerTruck
[[4, 2, 6], [7, 2, 2]] # Amount of each material transported per truck from each warehouse. Inner list corresponds to materials, outer to warehouses.
3. MinMaterial
[240, 80, 120] # Minimum required amount for each material

Decision variable:
1. Trucks
Integer variable, \( x_{w} \) for \( w \in W \), representing the number of trucks dispatched from warehouse \( w \).

Objective:
Minimize the total freight cost.
min: \sum_{w \in W} FreightCost[w] * x_{w}

Constraint:
1. Material requirement constraints
For each material, the total amount transported must meet the minimum requirement.
\sum_{w \in W} MaterialPerTruck[w,m] * x_{w} \geq MinMaterial[m], \forall m \in M
2. Non-negativity
\( x_{w} \geq 0, \forall w \in W \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
ILP
