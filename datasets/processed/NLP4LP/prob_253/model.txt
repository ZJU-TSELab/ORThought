Set:
1. CompanyType
The set of company types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for specialized, 1 for common

Parameter:
1. AnnotationRate
[60, 40] # Images annotated per hour for each company type
2. HourlyCost
[100, 72] # Cost per hour for each company type
3. TotalImages
10000 # Minimum number of images to be annotated
4. SpecializedWorkRatio
1/3 # Minimum ratio of work to be allocated to the specialized company

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfImages
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of images assigned to each company.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of annotating the dataset.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} (HourlyCost[i] / AnnotationRate[i]) \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total images
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \geq TotalImages \)
2. Specialized company work
\( x_{0} \geq SpecializedWorkRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
