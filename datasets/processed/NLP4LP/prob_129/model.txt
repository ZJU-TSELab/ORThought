Set:
1. BeamType
The set of beam types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Beam 1, 1 for Beam 2

Parameter:
1. PancreasDose
[0.3, 0.2] # Units of medicine per minute to the pancreas for each beam type
2. SkinDose
[0.2, 0.1] # Units of medicine per minute to the skin for each beam type
3. TumorDose
[0.6, 0.4] # Units of medicine per minute to the tumor for each beam type
4. MaxSkinDose
4 # Maximum units of medicine to be received by the skin
5. MinTumorDose
3 # Minimum units of medicine to be delivered to the tumor

Decision variable:
1. BeamMinutes
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of minutes of each beam.

Objective:
Minimize the total radiation received by the pancreas.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PancreasDose[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Skin dose constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} SkinDose[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxSkinDose \)
2. Tumor dose constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} TumorDose[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTumorDose \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
