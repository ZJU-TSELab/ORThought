Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Tractor, 1 for Car

Parameter:
1. CapacityPerVehicle
[40, 20] # Kilograms of corn each vehicle type can carry
2. MinTotalCorn
500 # Minimum total kilograms of corn to be transported
3. CarToTractorRatio
2 # The number of cars must be at least twice the number of tractors

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of vehicles used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum corn constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CapacityPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalCorn \)
2. Vehicle ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \geq CarToTractorRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
