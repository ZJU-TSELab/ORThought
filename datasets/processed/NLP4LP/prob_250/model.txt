Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for motorcycle, 1 for sedan

Parameter:
1. TransportCapacity
[30, 70] # People transported per shift for each vehicle type
2. PollutionProduction
[4, 15] # Units of pollution produced per shift for each vehicle type
3. Earnings
[100, 225] # Earnings per shift for each vehicle type
4. MaxMotorcycleRatio
0.25 # Maximum ratio of motorcycles to total vehicles
5. PollutionLimit
200 # Maximum total units of pollution allowed
6. MinTransportCapacity
1200 # Minimum total people to be transported per shift

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to purchase.

Objective:
Maximize the total earnings for the taxi company per shift.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} Earnings[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Motorcycle ratio
\( x_{0} \leq MaxMotorcycleRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
2. Pollution limit
\( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} < PollutionLimit \)
3. Transport capacity
\( \sum_{i \in I} TransportCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTransportCapacity \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
