Set:
1. FoodType
The set of food types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Rice, 1 for Kebab
2. NutrientType
The set of nutrient types, \( N = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Calories, 1 for Protein

Parameter:
1. CostPerServing
[3, 2] # Cost per serving for each food type
2. MinNutrientRequirement
[2200, 30] # Minimum required units for each nutrient type
3. NutrientContent
[[300, 200], [4.5, 4]] # Units of each nutrient per serving of each food type

Decision variable:
1. Servings
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of servings of food type \( t \).

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of the diet.
min: \sum_{t \in T} CostPerServing[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Nutrient requirement constraint
\sum_{t \in T} NutrientContent[n][t] * x_{t} \geq MinNutrientRequirement[n], for all \( n \in N \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
