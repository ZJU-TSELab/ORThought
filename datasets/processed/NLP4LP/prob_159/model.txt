Set:
1. SuitcaseType
The set of suitcase types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Suitcase, 1 for Large Suitcase

Parameter:
1. SnacksPerSuitcase
[50, 80] # Number of snacks each suitcase type can hold
2. MaxSmallSuitcases
70 # Maximum number of small suitcases available
3. MaxLargeSuitcases
50 # Maximum number of large suitcases available
4. MaxTotalSuitcases
70 # Maximum total number of suitcases that can be sent
5. MinLargeSuitcases
15 # Minimum number of large suitcases to be sent
6. MinSmallToLargeRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of small suitcases to large suitcases

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfSuitcases
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of suitcases of each type to send.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of snacks that can be delivered.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} SnacksPerSuitcase[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Maximum small suitcases constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxSmallSuitcases \)
2. Maximum large suitcases constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxLargeSuitcases \)
3. Total suitcases constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq MaxTotalSuitcases \)
4. Minimum large suitcases constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeSuitcases \)
5. Small to large ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
