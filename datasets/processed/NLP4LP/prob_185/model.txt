Set:
1. ShipType
The set of ship types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Large Ship, 1 for Small Ship

Parameter:
1. ContainersPerShip
[500, 200] # Number of containers each ship type can carry
2. MinContainers
3000 # Minimum number of containers to be transported

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfShips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of ships of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of ships used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum containers constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ContainersPerShip[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinContainers \)
2. Ship ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq x_{1} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
IP
