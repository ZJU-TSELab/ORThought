Set:
1. WagonType
The set of wagon types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Wagon, 1 for Large Wagon

Parameter:
1. OrePerWagon
[20, 50] # Units of ore each wagon type can hold
2. MinOre
2000 # Minimum units of ore to be taken to the surface
3. MinLargeWagons
10 # Minimum number of large wagons to be used
4. MinSmallToLargeRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of small wagons to large wagons

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfWagons
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of wagons of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of wagons needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Ore transportation requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} OrePerWagon[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinOre \)
2. Minimum large wagons constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeWagons \)
3. Small to large wagon ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
