Set:
1. EquipmentType
The set of equipment types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Chop Saw, 1 for Steel Cutter

Parameter:
1. SteelCutPerDay
[25, 5] # Pounds of steel cut per day for each equipment type
2. WastePerDay
[25, 3] # Units of waste generated per day for each equipment type
3. MinSteelCut
520 # Minimum pounds of metal to be cut every day
4. MaxWaste
400 # Maximum units of waste that can be produced every day

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfEquipment
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of equipment of each type to purchase.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of metal-working equipment needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Steel cutting demand
\( \sum_{i \in I} SteelCutPerDay[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinSteelCut \)
2. Waste limitation
\( \sum_{i \in I} WastePerDay[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWaste \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
