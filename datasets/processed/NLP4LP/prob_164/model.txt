Set:
1. VolunteerType
The set of volunteer types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Seasonal, 1 for Full-time

Parameter:
1. GiftsPerVolunteer
[5, 8] # Number of gifts each volunteer type can deliver
2. PointsPerVolunteer
[2, 5] # Points awarded for each volunteer type
3. MaxPoints
200 # Maximum number of points that can be given out
4. MaxSeasonalRatio
0.3 # Maximum ratio of seasonal volunteers to the total number of volunteers, which translates to 7*S <= 3*F
5. MinFullTime
10 # Minimum number of full-time volunteers required

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVolunteers
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of volunteers of each type to hire.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of gifts that can be delivered.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} GiftsPerVolunteer[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Points constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PointsPerVolunteer[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPoints \)
2. Seasonal ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxSeasonalRatio \cdot (x_{0} + x_{1}) \)
3. Minimum full-time volunteers constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinFullTime \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
