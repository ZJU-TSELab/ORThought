Set:
1. ACType
The set of air conditioner types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for low-power, 1 for high-power

Parameter:
1. CoolingCapacity
[12, 17] # Housing units cooled by each AC type
2. ElectricityConsumption
[150, 250] # Electricity units consumed per day by each AC type
3. MinTotalCooling
250 # Minimum total housing units to be cooled
4. MaxTotalElectricity
3400 # Maximum total electricity units available
5. MaxLowPowerRatio
0.3 # Maximum proportion of low-power ACs relative to the total number of ACs
6. MinHighPower
7 # Minimum number of high-power ACs that must be used

Decision variable:
1. NumACs
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of ACs of each type to buy.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of air conditioners.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total cooling capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CoolingCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalCooling \)
2. Total electricity consumption constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ElectricityConsumption[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxTotalElectricity \)
3. Low-power AC ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxLowPowerRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. High-power minimum constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinHighPower \)
5. Non-negativity and Integer
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \) and integer, for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
