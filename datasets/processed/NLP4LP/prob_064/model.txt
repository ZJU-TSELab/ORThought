Set:
1. MachineType
The set of machine types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Traditional, 1 for Modern

Parameter:
1. TeaYield
[30, 40] # kg of tea leaves picked per acre by each machine type
2. WasteProduction
[10, 15] # kg of waste created per acre by each machine type
3. FuelConsumption
[20, 15] # liters of fuel required per acre by each machine type
4. TotalAcres
500 # acres of land available
5. MaxFuel
9000 # liters of fuel available
6. MaxWaste
6000 # kg of waste that can be handled

Decision variable:
1. AcresToHarvest
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of acres to be harvested by each machine type.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of tea leaves that can be picked.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} TeaYield[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Land constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq TotalAcres \)
2. Fuel constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} FuelConsumption[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxFuel \)
3. Waste constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WasteProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWaste \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
