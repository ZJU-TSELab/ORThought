Set:
1. TruckType
The set of truck types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Truck, 1 for Large Truck

Parameter:
1. PeoplePerTruck
[2, 4] # Number of people required for each truck type
2. SnowPerTruck
[30, 50] # Units of snow each truck type can carry
3. MaxPeople
30 # Maximum number of people available
4. MinSmallTrucks
10 # Minimum number of small trucks to be used
5. MinLargeTrucks
3 # Minimum number of large trucks to be used
6. SmallToLargeRatio
2 # The number of small trucks must be twice the number of large trucks

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrucks
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trucks of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} SnowPerTruck[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Labor constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeoplePerTruck[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPeople \)
2. Minimum small trucks constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallTrucks \)
3. Minimum large trucks constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeTrucks \)
4. Truck ratio constraint
\( x_{0} = SmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
