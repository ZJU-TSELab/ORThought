Set:
1. BoatType
The set of boat types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Regular Boat, 1 for Speed Boat

Parameter:
1. MailPerTrip
[20, 30] # Pieces of mail each boat type can carry
2. GasPerTrip
[10, 20] # Liters of gas used per trip for each boat type
3. MinMail
1000 # Minimum pieces of mail to be delivered
4. MaxRegularTrips
20 # Maximum number of regular boat trips
5. MinSpeedBoatTripProportion
0.50 # Minimum proportion of total trips that must be by speed boats

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each boat type.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of gas consumed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} GasPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Mail delivery requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} MailPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinMail \)
2. Maximum regular boat trips
\( x_{0} \leq MaxRegularTrips \)
3. Speed boat trip proportion
\( x_{1} \geq MinSpeedBoatTripProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
