Set:
1. ChemicalType
The set of chemical types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for cleansing, 1 for odor-removing

Parameter:
1. EffectivenessTime
[4, 6] # Minutes per unit for each chemical type to be effective
2. MinCleansingChemical
100 # Minimum units of cleansing chemical to be used
3. MaxTotalChemicals
300 # Maximum total units of chemicals allowed
4. CleansingToOdorRatio
2 # Maximum ratio of cleansing chemical to odor-removing chemical

Decision variable:
1. ChemicalUnits
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of units of chemical type \( i \) to be used.

Objective:
Minimize the total time it takes for a house to be cleaned.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} EffectivenessTime[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum cleansing chemical constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinCleansingChemical \)
2. Maximum total chemicals constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq MaxTotalChemicals \)
3. Strength ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq CleansingToOdorRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
