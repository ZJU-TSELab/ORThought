Set:
1. ProductType
The set of product types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Scooters, 1 for Bikes
2. TeamType
The set of team types, \( E = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Design Team, 1 for Engineering Team

Parameter:
1. Profit
[200, 300] # Profit per product for each product type
2. HoursAvailable
[5000, 6000] # Hours available per month for each team type
3. HoursRequired
[[2, 4], [3, 5]] # Hours required from each team for each product type

Decision variable:
1. ProductCount
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of products of type \( t \) to make per month.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{t \in T} Profit[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Team hours constraint
\sum_{t \in T} HoursRequired[e][t] * x_{t} \leq HoursAvailable[e], for all \( e \in E \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
