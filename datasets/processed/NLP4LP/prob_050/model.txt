Set:
1. FurnaceType
The set of furnace types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for New Model, 1 for Old Model

Parameter:
1. ApartmentsHeated
[10, 15] # Number of apartments heated by each furnace type
2. KwhConsumedPerDay
[200, 250] # kWh consumed per day by each furnace type
3. MinApartmentsToHeat
200 # Minimum apartments to heat
4. MaxKwhAvailable
3500 # Maximum kWh of electricity available per day
5. MaxOldModelRatio
0.35 # Maximum ratio of old model furnaces
6. MinNewModelFurnaces
5 # Minimum number of new model furnaces

Decision variable:
1. FurnaceCount
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of furnaces of type \( t \) to purchase.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of furnaces.
min: \sum_{t \in T} x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Heating capacity constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ApartmentsHeated[t] * x_{t} \geq MinApartmentsToHeat
2. Electricity consumption constraint
\sum_{t \in T} KwhConsumedPerDay[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxKwhAvailable
3. Old model proportion constraint
x_{1} \leq MaxOldModelRatio * \sum_{t \in T} x_{t}
4. Minimum new model furnaces constraint
x_{0} \geq MinNewModelFurnaces
5. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
