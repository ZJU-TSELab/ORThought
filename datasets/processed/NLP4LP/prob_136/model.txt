Set:
1. BridgeType
The set of bridge types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Beam Bridge, 1 for Truss Bridge

Parameter:
1. PopsicleSticksPerBridge
[30, 50] # Number of popsicle sticks required for each bridge type
2. GluePerBridge
[5, 8] # Units of glue required for each bridge type
3. WeightCapacityPerBridge
[40, 60] # Grams of weight each bridge type can hold
4. MaxPopsicleSticks
600 # Maximum number of popsicle sticks available
5. MaxGlue
100 # Maximum units of glue available
6. MaxTrussBridges
5 # Maximum number of truss bridges that can be built

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBridges
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of bridges of each type to build.

Objective:
Maximize the total mass that can be supported.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} WeightCapacityPerBridge[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Popsicle sticks constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PopsicleSticksPerBridge[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPopsicleSticks \)
2. Glue constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} GluePerBridge[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxGlue \)
3. Maximum truss bridges constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxTrussBridges \)
4. Beam bridges greater than truss bridges constraint
\( x_{0} \geq x_{1} + 1 \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
