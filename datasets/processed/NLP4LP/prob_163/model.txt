Set:
1. BinType
The set of bin types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Bin, 1 for Large Bin

Parameter:
1. WorkersPerBin
[2, 5] # Number of workers required for each bin type
2. RecyclingPerBin
[25, 60] # Units of recycling material each bin type can hold
3. MaxWorkers
100 # Maximum number of workers available
4. MinSmallBins
10 # Minimum number of small bins to be used
5. MinLargeBins
4 # Minimum number of large bins to be used
6. SmallToLargeRatio
3 # Required ratio of small bins to large bins

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBins
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of bins of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of recycling material that can be collected.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} RecyclingPerBin[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Worker constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WorkersPerBin[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWorkers \)
2. Minimum small bins constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallBins \)
3. Minimum large bins constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeBins \)
4. Small to large bin ratio constraint
\( x_{0} = SmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
