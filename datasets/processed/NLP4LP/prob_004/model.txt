Set:
1. EmployeeType
The set of employee types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Senior Citizens, 1 for Young Adults

Parameter:
1. Wage
[500, 750] # Weekly wage per employee type
2. WageBudget
30000 # Maximum weekly wage bill
3. MinTotalWorkers
50 # Minimum number of workers required
4. MinYoungAdults
10 # Minimum number of young adults required
5. YoungToSeniorRatio
3 # The number of young adults must be at least 1/3 of the number of senior citizens, so 3 * YoungAdults >= SeniorCitizens

Decision variable:
1. EmployeeCount
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of employees of type \( t \) to hire.

Objective:
Minimize the total weekly wage bill.
min: \sum_{t \in T} Wage[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Wage budget constraint
\sum_{t \in T} Wage[t] * x_{t} \leq WageBudget
2. Total workers constraint
\sum_{t \in T} x_{t} \geq MinTotalWorkers
3. Minimum young adults constraint
x_{1} \geq MinYoungAdults
4. Young to senior ratio constraint
YoungToSeniorRatio * x_{1} \geq x_{0}
5. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, \forall t \in T

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
