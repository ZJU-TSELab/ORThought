Set:
1. CrateType
The set of crate types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small, 1 for Large

Parameter:
1. BananaCapacity
[20, 50] # Bananas held by each crate type
2. MaxBananas
500 # Total bananas available
3. MinSmallCrates
5 # Minimum number of small crates to be used
4. LargeToSmallRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of large crates to small crates

Decision variable:
1. CrateCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of crates of type \( i \) to be used.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of crates produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Banana limit constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BananaCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBananas \)
2. Minimum small crates constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallCrates \)
3. Large to small ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \geq LargeToSmallRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
