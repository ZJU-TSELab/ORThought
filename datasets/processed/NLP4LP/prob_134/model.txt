Set:
1. ProcessType
The set of process types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Process 1, 1 for Process 2

Parameter:
1. PainKillersPerHour
[35, 50] # Units of pain killers produced per hour for each process type
2. SleepingPillsPerHour
[12, 30] # Units of sleeping pills produced per hour for each process type
3. MaterialPerHour
[50, 60] # Units of preliminary material required per hour for each process type
4. MinPainKillers
1200 # Minimum units of pain killers to be made
5. MinSleepingPills
1200 # Minimum units of sleeping pills to be made
6. MaxMaterial
2000 # Maximum units of preliminary material available

Decision variable:
1. ProcessHours
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of hours each process is run.

Objective:
Minimize the total time needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Pain killers production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PainKillersPerHour[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinPainKillers \)
2. Sleeping pills production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} SleepingPillsPerHour[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinSleepingPills \)
3. Material constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MaterialPerHour[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMaterial \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
