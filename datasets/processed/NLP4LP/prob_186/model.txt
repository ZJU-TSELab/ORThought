Set:
1. BoatType
The set of boat types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Canoe, 1 for Diesel Boat

Parameter:
1. FishPerBoat
[10, 15] # Number of fish each boat type can carry
2. MinFish
1000 # Minimum number of fish to be transported
3. CanoeToDieselRatio
3 # The number of canoes must be at least three times the number of diesel boats

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBoats
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of boats of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of boats needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum fish constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} FishPerBoat[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinFish \)
2. Boat ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq CanoeToDieselRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
IP
