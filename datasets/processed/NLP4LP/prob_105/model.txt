Set:
1. FactoryType
The set of factory types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Factory 1, 1 for Factory 2

Parameter:
1. AcneCreamProduction
[12, 20] # Units of acne cream produced per hour by each factory type
2. AntiBacterialCreamProduction
[15, 10] # Units of anti-bacterial cream produced per hour by each factory type
3. BaseGelUsage
[30, 45] # Units of base gel used per hour by each factory type
4. MinAcneCream
800 # Minimum units of acne cream to be produced
5. MinAntiBacterialCream
1000 # Minimum units of anti-bacterial cream to be produced
6. MaxBaseGel
5000 # Maximum units of base gel available

Decision variable:
1. FactoryHours
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of hours each factory is run.
2. MaxHour
Continuous variable, \( z \), representing the maximum of the factory hours.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum of the factory hours.
min: \( z \)

Constraint:
1. Acne cream production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} AcneCreamProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinAcneCream \)
2. Anti-bacterial cream production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} AntiBacterialCreamProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinAntiBacterialCream \)
3. Base gel constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BaseGelUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBaseGel \)
4. Max hour constraint
\( z \geq x_{i} \), for all \( i \in I \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)
\( z \geq 0 \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
