Set:
1. ExperimentType
The set of experiment types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Experiment 1, 1 for Experiment 2

Parameter:
1. RedLiquidPerExperiment
[3, 5] # Units of red liquid required for each experiment type
2. BlueLiquidPerExperiment
[4, 3] # Units of blue liquid required for each experiment type
3. GreenGasPerExperiment
[5, 6] # Units of green gas produced by each experiment type
4. SmellyGasPerExperiment
[1, 2] # Units of smelly gas produced by each experiment type
5. MaxRedLiquid
80 # Maximum units of red liquid available
6. MaxBlueLiquid
70 # Maximum units of blue liquid available
7. MaxSmellyGas
10 # Maximum units of smelly gas that can be produced

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfExperiments
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each experiment is performed.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of green gas produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} GreenGasPerExperiment[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Red liquid constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} RedLiquidPerExperiment[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxRedLiquid \)
2. Blue liquid constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BlueLiquidPerExperiment[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBlueLiquid \)
3. Smelly gas constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} SmellyGasPerExperiment[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxSmellyGas \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
