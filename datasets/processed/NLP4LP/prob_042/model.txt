Set:
1. ProcessType
The set of process types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Process A, 1 for Process B
2. ResourceType
The set of resource types, \( R = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Gold, 1 for Wires

Parameter:
1. CoinsPlated
[5, 7] # Number of coins plated by each process type
2. ResourceAvailability
[500, 300] # Available units for each resource type
3. ResourceConsumption
[[3, 5], [2, 3]] # Units of each resource required by each process type

Decision variable:
1. ProcessRuns
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of times to run process type \( t \).

Objective:
Maximize the total number of coins plated.
max: \sum_{t \in T} CoinsPlated[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Resource availability constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ResourceConsumption[r][t] * x_{t} \leq ResourceAvailability[r], for all \( r \in R \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
