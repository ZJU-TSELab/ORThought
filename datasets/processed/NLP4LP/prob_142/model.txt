Set:
1. VanType
The set of van types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Old Van, 1 for New Van

Parameter:
1. BottlesPerVan
[100, 80] # Number of soda bottles each van type can take
2. PollutionPerVan
[50, 30] # Units of pollution produced by each van type
3. MinBottles
5000 # Minimum number of bottles to be sent
4. MaxNewVans
30 # Maximum number of new vans that can be used

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVans
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vans of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of pollution produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionPerVan[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Bottle transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} BottlesPerVan[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinBottles \)
2. Maximum new vans
\( x_{1} \leq MaxNewVans \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
