Set:
1. TransportType
The set of transport types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Trains, 1 for Trams

Parameter:
1. Capacity
[120, 30] # People transported per hour for each type
2. MinTotalCapacity
600 # Minimum people to transport per hour
3. TramTrainRatio
2 # The number of trams must be at least this many times the number of trains

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfUnits
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of units for each transport type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of transportation units.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total capacity
\( \sum_{i \in I} Capacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalCapacity \)
2. Tram-train relationship
\( x_{1} \geq TramTrainRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
