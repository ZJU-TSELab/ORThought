Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Van, 1 for Car

Parameter:
1. PeoplePerVehicle
[6, 3] # Number of people each vehicle type can transport
2. MinVoters
200 # Minimum number of voters to be transported
3. MaxVanRatio
0.3 # The number of vans cannot exceed 30% of the total vehicles

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of cars used.
min: \( x_{1} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum voters constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeoplePerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinVoters \)
2. Vehicle ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq \frac{MaxVanRatio}{1 - MaxVanRatio} \cdot x_{1} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
