Set:
1. FactorySize
The set of factory sizes, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Medium, 1 for Small

Parameter:
1. ToyProduction
[50, 35] # Toys made per day by each factory size
2. OperatorRequirement
[3, 2] # Operators required for each factory size
3. MinToys
250 # Minimum total toys to be made per day
4. MaxOperators
16 # Maximum number of operators available

Decision variable:
1. FactoryCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of factories of size \( i \) to be built.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of factories.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Toy production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ToyProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinToys \)
2. Operator availability constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} OperatorRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxOperators \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
