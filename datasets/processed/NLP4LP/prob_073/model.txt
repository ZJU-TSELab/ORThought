Set:
1. ExperimentType
The set of experiment types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Alpha, 1 for Beta

Parameter:
1. MetalRequirement
[3, 5] # Units of metal required for each experiment type
2. AcidRequirement
[5, 4] # Units of acid required for each experiment type
3. ElectricityProduction
[8, 10] # Units of electricity produced by each experiment type
4. MaxMetal
800 # Units of metal available
5. MaxAcid
750 # Units of acid available

Decision variable:
1. ExperimentCount
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each experiment is conducted.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of electricity produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ElectricityProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Metal constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MetalRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMetal \)
2. Acid constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} AcidRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxAcid \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
