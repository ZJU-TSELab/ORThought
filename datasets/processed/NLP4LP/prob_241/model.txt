Set:
1. UnitType
The set of mobile production unit types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Large, 1 for Small

Parameter:
1. PeopleCapacityPerUnit
[6, 2] # Number of people each unit type can hold
2. ParkingSpotsPerUnit
[2, 1] # Number of parking spots each unit type takes up
3. MinTotalPeople
80 # Minimum number of people to transport
4. MinSmallUnits
5 # Minimum number of small mobile units required
5. MinLargeUnitRatio
0.75 # Minimum ratio of large units to the total number of units

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfUnits
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of units for each type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of parking spots.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} ParkingSpotsPerUnit[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total people capacity
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeopleCapacityPerUnit[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalPeople \)
2. Minimum small units
\( x_{1} \geq MinSmallUnits \)
3. Large unit proportion
\( x_{0} \geq MinLargeUnitRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
