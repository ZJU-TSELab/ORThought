Set:
1. ShipSize
The set of ship sizes, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Large, 1 for Small

Parameter:
1. CapacityPerTrip
[2000, 800] # Number of customers each ship size can carry per trip
2. PollutionPerTrip
[20, 15] # Units of pollution produced per trip for each ship size
3. MaxLargeTrips
7 # Maximum number of large cruise ship trips
4. MinSmallTripRatio
0.4 # Minimum ratio of small cruise ship trips to total trips
5. MinCustomers
20000 # Minimum number of customers to transport

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each ship size.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of pollution produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Maximum large trips
\( x_{0} \leq MaxLargeTrips \)
2. Customer capacity
\( \sum_{i \in I} CapacityPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCustomers \)
3. Small ship proportion
\( x_{1} \geq MinSmallTripRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
