Set:
1. ProductType
The set of product types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Hams, 1 for Pork Ribs

Parameter:
1. SlicerHoursPerBatch
[4, 2] # Hours on the meat slicer required for each product type
2. PackerHoursPerBatch
[2.5, 3.5] # Hours on the meat packer required for each product type
3. MaxHours
[4000, 4000] # Maximum available hours for the meat slicer and meat packer
4. ProfitPerBatch
[150, 300] # Profit per batch for each product type

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBatches
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of batches of each product type to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProfitPerBatch[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Meat slicer time constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} SlicerHoursPerBatch[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxHours[0] \)
2. Meat packer time constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PackerHoursPerBatch[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxHours[1] \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
