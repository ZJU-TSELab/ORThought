Set:
1. SyrupType
The set of syrup types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Syrup 1, 1 for Syrup 2

Parameter:
1. ThroatMedicine
[0.5, 0.2] # Units of medicine delivered to the throat per serving for each syrup type
2. LungMedicine
[0.4, 0.5] # Units of medicine delivered to the lungs per serving for each syrup type
3. Sugar
[0.5, 0.3] # Units of sugar per serving for each syrup type
4. MaxThroatMedicine
5 # Maximum units of medicine for the throat
5. MinLungMedicine
4 # Minimum units of medicine for the lungs

Decision variable:
1. SyrupServings
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of servings of each syrup type to be taken.

Objective:
Minimize the total sugar intake.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} Sugar[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Throat medicine constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ThroatMedicine[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxThroatMedicine \)
2. Lung medicine constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} LungMedicine[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinLungMedicine \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
