Set:
1. BottleType
The set of bottle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Bottle, 1 for Large Bottle

Parameter:
1. HoneyPerBottle
[5, 20] # Units of honey each bottle type can hold
2. MaxSmallBottles
300 # Maximum number of small bottles available
3. MaxLargeBottles
100 # Maximum number of large bottles available
4. MaxTotalBottles
200 # Maximum total number of bottles that can be transported
5. MinLargeBottles
50 # Minimum number of large bottles to be used
6. MinSmallToLargeRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of small bottles to large bottles

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBottles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of bottles of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of honey he can transport.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} HoneyPerBottle[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Maximum small bottles constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxSmallBottles \)
2. Maximum large bottles constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxLargeBottles \)
3. Total bottles constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq MaxTotalBottles \)
4. Minimum large bottles constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeBottles \)
5. Small to large ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
