Set:
1. MethodType
The set of method types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for method A, 1 for method B

Parameter:
1. FabricProduction
[25, 45] # Units of fabric produced per hour for each method
2. PlasticProduction
[14, 25] # Units of plastic produced per hour for each method
3. ElementRequirement
[60, 65] # Units of special element required per hour for each method
4. ElementAvailable
3500 # Total units of special element available
5. MinFabric
1400 # Minimum units of fabric to be made
6. MinPlastic
1000 # Minimum units of plastic to be made

Decision variable:
1. HoursOfExecution
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of hours each method is executed.

Objective:
Minimize the total time needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Fabric production
\( \sum_{i \in I} FabricProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinFabric \)
2. Plastic production
\( \sum_{i \in I} PlasticProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinPlastic \)
3. Element availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} ElementRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq ElementAvailable \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
