Set:
1. TransportType
The set of transport types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Container, 1 for Truck

Parameter:
1. OilPerUnit
[30, 40] # Units of oil each transport type can hold
2. MinOil
2000 # Minimum units of oil to be sent
3. MinContainers
15 # Minimum number of containers to be used
4. MaxTruckToContainerRatio
0.5 # Maximum ratio of trucks to containers

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfUnits
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of units of each transport type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of containers and trucks needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Oil transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} OilPerUnit[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinOil \)
2. Minimum containers constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinContainers \)
3. Truck to container ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxTruckToContainerRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
