Set:
1. ContainerType
The set of container types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Container, 1 for Large Container

Parameter:
1. PeoplePerContainer
[1, 3] # Number of people required to unload each container type
2. SandPerContainer
[20, 50] # Units of sand each container type can hold
3. MaxPeople
100 # Maximum number of people available
4. MinSmallContainers
5 # Minimum number of small containers to be used
5. MinLargeContainers
3 # Minimum number of large containers to be used
6. SmallToLargeRatio
3 # Required ratio of small containers to large containers

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfContainers
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of containers of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of sand that they can deliver.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} SandPerContainer[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. People constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeoplePerContainer[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPeople \)
2. Minimum small containers constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallContainers \)
3. Minimum large containers constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeContainers \)
4. Small to large container ratio constraint
\( x_{0} = SmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
