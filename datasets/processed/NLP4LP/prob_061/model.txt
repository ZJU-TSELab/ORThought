Set:
1. BranchSize
The set of branch sizes, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small, 1 for Large

Parameter:
1. CustomerServiceCapacity
[50, 100] # Customers served per day by each branch size
2. TellerRequirement
[10, 15] # Bank tellers required for each branch size
3. MinCustomerService
1200 # Minimum total customers to be served per day
4. MaxTellers
200 # Maximum number of bank tellers available

Decision variable:
1. BranchCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of branches of size \( i \) to be built.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of branches.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Customer service constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CustomerServiceCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCustomerService \)
2. Teller availability constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} TellerRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxTellers \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
