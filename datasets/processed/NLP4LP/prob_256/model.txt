Set:
1. EquipmentType
The set of equipment types, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Basketballs, 1 for Footballs

Parameter:
1. MaterialUsage
[5, 3] # Units of materials required per equipment for each type
2. TimeUsage
[1, 2] # Hours required per equipment for each type
3. MaterialAvailable
1500 # Total units of materials available
4. TimeAvailable
750 # Total hours available
5. MinFootballs
50 # Minimum number of footballs to produce

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfEquipment
Integer variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of units of each equipment type to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of sports equipment produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Material Availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{MaterialUsage}[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq \text{MaterialAvailable} \)
2. Time Availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{TimeUsage}[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq \text{TimeAvailable} \)
3. Production Ratio
\( x_{0} \geq 3 \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Minimum Footballs
\( x_{1} \geq \text{MinFootballs} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
