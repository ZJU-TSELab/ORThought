Set:
1. FlooringType
The set of flooring types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Hardwood, 1 for Vinyl

Parameter:
1. MinDemand
[20000, 10000] # Minimum weekly demand in square feet for each flooring type
2. MaxProduction
[50000, 30000] # Maximum weekly production in square feet for each flooring type
3. MinTotalShipment
60000 # Minimum total weekly shipment in square feet
4. ProfitPerSqFoot
[2.5, 3] # Profit per square foot for each flooring type

Decision variable:
1. FlooringProduction
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the square feet of flooring type \( t \) to produce weekly.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{t \in T} ProfitPerSqFoot[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Minimum demand constraint
x_{t} \geq MinDemand[t], for all \( t \in T \)
2. Maximum production constraint
x_{t} \leq MaxProduction[t], for all \( t \in T \)
3. Minimum total shipment constraint
\sum_{t \in T} x_{t} \geq MinTotalShipment
4. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
