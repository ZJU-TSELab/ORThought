Set:
1. ToyType
The set of toy types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Plush Toy, 1 for Doll

Parameter:
1. CostPerToy
[3, 2] # Cost to the store for each toy type
2. ProfitPerToy
[4, 2] # Profit from selling each toy type
3. MaxBudget
700 # Maximum amount the owner can spend on inventory
4. MinPlushToys
90 # Minimum number of plush toys to be sold
5. MaxPlushToys
190 # Maximum number of plush toys to be sold
6. DollToPlushRatio
2 # The number of dolls sold is at most twice the number of plush toys sold

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfToys
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of toys of each type to buy and sell.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProfitPerToy[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerToy[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBudget \)
2. Minimum plush toys constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinPlushToys \)
3. Maximum plush toys constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxPlushToys \)
4. Doll to plush toy ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \leq DollToPlushRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
