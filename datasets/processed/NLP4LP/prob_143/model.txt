Set:
1. TeamType
The set of team types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Team, 1 for Large Team

Parameter:
1. EmployeesPerTeam
[3, 5] # Number of employees required for each team type
2. LawnAreaPerTeam
[50, 80] # Square feet of lawn each team type can mow
3. MaxEmployees
150 # Maximum number of employees available
4. MinSmallTeams
10 # Minimum number of small teams required
5. MinLargeTeams
6 # Minimum number of large teams required
6. MinSmallToLargeRatio
3 # Minimum ratio of small teams to large teams

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTeams
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of teams of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of lawn that can be mowed.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} LawnAreaPerTeam[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Employee constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} EmployeesPerTeam[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxEmployees \)
2. Minimum small teams constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallTeams \)
3. Minimum large teams constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeTeams \)
4. Small to large team ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinSmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
