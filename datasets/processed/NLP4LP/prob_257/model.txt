Set:
1. ExperimentType
The set of experiment types, I = {0, 1} # 0 for In-vivo, 1 for Ex-vivo

Parameter:
1. PreparationTime
[30, 45] # Minutes required for preparation for each experiment type
2. ExecutionTime
[60, 30] # Minutes required for execution for each experiment type
3. Radiation
[2, 3] # Units of radiation received from each experiment type
4. PreparationTimeLimit
400 # Total minutes available for preparation
5. ExecutionTimeLimit
500 # Total minutes available for execution

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfExperiments
Integer variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of experiments of each type to be scheduled.

Objective:
Minimize the total radiation received.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} \text{Radiation}[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Preparation Time Limit
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{PreparationTime}[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq \text{PreparationTimeLimit} \)
2. Execution Time Limit
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{ExecutionTime}[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq \text{ExecutionTimeLimit} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
