Set:
1. CarModel
The set of car models, \( M = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Regular, 1 for Premium

Parameter:
1. Profit
[5000, 8500] # Profit per car model
2. DemandLimit
[8, 6] # Maximum daily demand for each car model
3. TotalCapacity
12 # Maximum total number of cars that can be made per day

Decision variable:
1. CarProduction
Continuous variable, \( x_{m} \) for all \( m \in M \), representing the number of cars of model \( m \) to make per day.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{m \in M} Profit[m] * x_{m}

Constraint:
1. Demand limit constraint
x_{m} \leq DemandLimit[m], for all \( m \in M \)
2. Total capacity constraint
\sum_{m \in M} x_{m} \leq TotalCapacity
3. Non-negativity
x_{m} \geq 0, for all \( m \in M \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
