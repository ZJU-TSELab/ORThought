Set:
1. PillType
The set of pill types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Prevention, 1 for Treatment

Parameter:
1. CostPerPill
[15, 25] # Cost to make each type of pill
2. MaxBudget
10000 # Maximum budget available for purchasing pills
3. MinTreatmentPills
50 # Minimum number of treatment pills to purchase
4. PreventionToTreatmentRatio
2 # The number of prevention pills must be at least twice the number of treatment pills

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfPills
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of pills of each type to purchase.

Objective:
Maximize the number of patients that can be treated (number of treatment pills).
max: \( x_{1} \)

Constraint:
1. Budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerPill[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBudget \)
2. Minimum treatment pills
\( x_{1} \geq MinTreatmentPills \)
3. Prevention to treatment ratio
\( x_{0} \geq PreventionToTreatmentRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
