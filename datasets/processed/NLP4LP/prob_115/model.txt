Set:
1. MachineType
The set of machine types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Machine 1, 1 for Machine 2

Parameter:
1. EyeCreamProduction
[30, 45] # ml of eye cream produced per hour by each machine type
2. FootCreamProduction
[60, 30] # ml of foot cream produced per hour by each machine type
3. WaterUsage
[20, 15] # ml of distilled water used per hour by each machine type
4. MinEyeCream
1300 # Minimum ml of eye cream to be produced
5. MinFootCream
1500 # Minimum ml of foot cream to be produced
6. MaxWater
1200 # Maximum ml of distilled water available

Decision variable:
1. MachineHours
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of hours each machine is used.
2. MaxHour
Continuous variable, \( z \), representing the maximum of the machine hours.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum of the machine hours.
min: \( z \)

Constraint:
1. Eye cream production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} EyeCreamProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinEyeCream \)
2. Foot cream production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} FootCreamProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinFootCream \)
3. Water constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WaterUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWater \)
4. Max hour constraint
\( z \geq x_{i} \), for all \( i \in I \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)
\( z \geq 0 \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
