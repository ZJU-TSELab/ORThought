Set:
1. FactoryType
The set of factory types, \( F = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Factory 1, 1 for Factory 2
2. BearColor
The set of bear colors, \( C = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Black, 1 for White, 2 for Brown

Parameter:
1. CostPerHour
[300, 600] # Cost per hour to run each factory
2. ProductionRate
[[5, 10], [6, 10], [3, 0]] # Bears of each color produced per hour by each factory
3. MinDemand
[20, 5, 15] # Minimum daily demand for each bear color

Decision variable:
1. HoursToRun
Continuous variable, \( x_{f} \) for all \( f \in F \), representing the hours to run factory \( f \).

Objective:
Minimize the total production cost.
min: \sum_{f \in F} CostPerHour[f] * x_{f}

Constraint:
1. Demand satisfaction constraint
\sum_{f \in F} ProductionRate[c][f] * x_{f} \geq MinDemand[c], for all \( c \in C \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{f} \geq 0, for all \( f \in F \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
