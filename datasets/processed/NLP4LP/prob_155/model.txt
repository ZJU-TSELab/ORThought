Set:
1. PlaneType
The set of plane types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Large Plane, 1 for Small Plane

Parameter:
1. CarsPerPlane
[30, 10] # Number of cars each plane type can carry
2. MinCars
300 # Minimum number of cars to be delivered

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfPlanes
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of planes of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of planes that can be used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Car delivery requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} CarsPerPlane[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCars \)
2. Large planes less than small planes constraint
\( x_{0} \leq x_{1} - 1 \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
