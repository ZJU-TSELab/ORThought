Set:
1. ProductType
The set of product types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Bagels, 1 for Croissants
2. ResourceType
The set of resource types, \( R = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Oven Time, 1 for Pastry Chef Time

Parameter:
1. ProfitPerBatch
[20, 40] # Profit per batch for each product type
2. HoursAvailable
[70, 32] # Hours available per day for each resource type
3. HoursRequired
[[2, 1], [0.25, 2]] # Hours of each resource required per batch of each product type

Decision variable:
1. BatchesToMake
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of batches of product type \( t \) to make.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{t \in T} ProfitPerBatch[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Resource hours constraint
\sum_{t \in T} HoursRequired[r][t] * x_{t} \leq HoursAvailable[r], for all \( r \in R \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
