Set:
1. ChocolateType
The set of chocolate types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Milk Chocolate, 1 for Dark Chocolate

Parameter:
1. CocoaRequirement
[4, 6] # Units of cocoa required for each chocolate type
2. MilkRequirement
[7, 3] # Units of milk required for each chocolate type
3. ProductionTime
[15, 12] # Minutes to make each chocolate type
4. MaxCocoa
2000 # Units of cocoa available
5. MaxMilk
1750 # Units of milk available
6. MilkToDarkRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of milk chocolate bars to dark chocolate bars

Decision variable:
1. ChocolateBarCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of chocolate bars of type \( i \) to be made.

Objective:
Minimize the total production time.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProductionTime[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Cocoa constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CocoaRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCocoa \)
2. Milk constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MilkRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMilk \)
3. Milk to dark ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MilkToDarkRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
