Set:
1. GrillType
The set of grill types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Gas, 1 for Electric

Parameter:
1. CookingCapacity
[20, 30] # Patties cooked per minute by each grill type
2. OilUsage
[20, 25] # Units of cooking oil used per minute by each grill type
3. MinPatties
150 # Minimum total patties to be cooked per minute
4. MaxOil
140 # Maximum total cooking oil to be used per minute

Decision variable:
1. GrillCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of grills of type \( i \) to be bought.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of grills.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Cooking capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CookingCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinPatties \)
2. Oil usage constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} OilUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxOil \)
3. Taste preference constraint
\( x_{1} \leq x_{0} - 1 \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
