Set:
1. SoilType
The set of soil types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for subsoil, 1 for topsoil

Parameter:
1. Water
[10, 6] # Water units required to hydrate each bag of soil type
2. TotalBags
150 # Maximum number of bags of soil that can be transported
3. MinTopsoil
10 # Minimum number of topsoil bags that must be used
4. MaxTopsoilRatio
0.3 # Maximum proportion of topsoil bags relative to the total number of bags

Decision variable:
1. NumBags
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of bags of each soil type to buy.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of water required.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} Water[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total bags constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq TotalBags \)
2. Topsoil minimum constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinTopsoil \)
3. Topsoil proportion constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxTopsoilRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity and Integer
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \) and integer, for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
