Set:
1. TransportType
The set of transport types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Car, 1 for Bus

Parameter:
1. EmployeesPerVehicle
[4, 20] # Number of employees each vehicle type can transport
2. PollutionPerVehicle
[10, 30] # Units of pollution produced by each vehicle type
3. MinEmployees
300 # Minimum number of employees to be transported
4. MaxBuses
4 # Maximum number of buses that can be used

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total pollution produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum employees constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} EmployeesPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinEmployees \)
2. Maximum buses constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxBuses \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
