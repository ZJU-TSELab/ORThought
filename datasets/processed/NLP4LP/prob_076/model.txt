Set:
1. SlicerType
The set of slicer types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Manual, 1 for Automatic

Parameter:
1. SlicingCapacity
[5, 8] # Slices cut per minute by each slicer type
2. GreaseConsumption
[3, 6] # Units of grease consumed per minute by each slicer type
3. MinSlicingCapacity
50 # Minimum total slices to be cut per minute
4. MaxGreaseConsumption
35 # Maximum total units of grease to be used per minute

Decision variable:
1. SlicerCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of slicers of type \( i \) to be bought.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of slicers.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Slicing capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} SlicingCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinSlicingCapacity \)
2. Grease consumption constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} GreaseConsumption[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxGreaseConsumption \)
3. Operational constraint
\( x_{0} \leq x_{1} - 1 \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
