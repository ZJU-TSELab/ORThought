Set:
1. WellSizeType
The set of well size types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small, 1 for Large
2. ResourceType
The set of resource types, \( R = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Land, 1 for Drill Bits, 2 for Pollution

Parameter:
1. OilProductionPerAcre
[2, 5] # Barrels of oil produced per acre by each well size type
2. ResourceAvailability
[300, 2500, 4500] # Available amount for each resource type (acres, drill bits, pollution units)
3. ResourceConsumption
[[1, 1], [5, 10], [10, 20]] # Resource consumption per acre for each well size type

Decision variable:
1. AcresToUse
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the acres to use for well size type \( t \).

Objective:
Maximize the total production of oil.
max: \sum_{t \in T} OilProductionPerAcre[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Land constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ResourceConsumption[0][t] * x_{t} \leq ResourceAvailability[0]
2. Drill bits constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ResourceConsumption[1][t] * x_{t} \leq ResourceAvailability[1]
3. Pollution constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ResourceConsumption[2][t] * x_{t} \leq ResourceAvailability[2]
4. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
