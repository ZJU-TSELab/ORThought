Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Sedans, 1 for Buses

Parameter:
1. TouristCapacity
[50, 250] # Tourists per day for each vehicle type
2. Pollution
[10, 40] # Units of pollution per day for each vehicle type
3. PollutionLimit
800 # Maximum units of pollution allowed per day
4. MinTourists
4600 # Minimum number of tourists to be served per day

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of vehicles of each type to purchase.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of vehicles needed.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Tourist Capacity
\( \sum_{i \in I} TouristCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTourists \)
2. Pollution Limit
\( \sum_{i \in I} Pollution[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq PollutionLimit \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
