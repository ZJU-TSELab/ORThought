Set:
1. BatchType
The set of batch types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for regular, 1 for premium

Parameter:
1. MedicinalIngredients
[50, 40] # Units of medicinal ingredients required per batch for each batch type
2. RehydrationProduct
[40, 60] # Units of rehydration product required per batch for each batch type
3. PeopleTreated
[50, 30] # Number of people treated per batch for each batch type
4. MaxMedicinalIngredients
3000 # Maximum units of medicinal ingredients available
5. MaxRehydrationProduct
3500 # Maximum units of rehydration product available
6. MinRegularBatches
10 # Minimum number of regular batches to be made

Decision variable:
1. BatchCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of batches of type \( i \) to be made.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of people that can be treated.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} PeopleTreated[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Medicinal ingredients constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MedicinalIngredients[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMedicinalIngredients \)
2. Rehydration product constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} RehydrationProduct[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxRehydrationProduct \)
3. Batch relationship constraint
\( x_{0} \leq x_{1} - 1 \)
4. Minimum regular batches constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinRegularBatches \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
IP
