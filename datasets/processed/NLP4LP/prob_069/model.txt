Set:
1. FirefighterType
The set of firefighter types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Regular, 1 for Emergency

Parameter:
1. HoursPerShift
[10, 6] # Hours worked per shift by each firefighter type
2. CostPerShift
[300, 100] # Dollars earned per shift by each firefighter type
3. MinHours
300 # Minimum total hours of firefighter time needed
4. MaxBudget
7000 # Dollars available in the budget

Decision variable:
1. FirefighterCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of firefighters of type \( i \) to be hired.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of firefighters.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Hours requirement constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} HoursPerShift[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinHours \)
2. Budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerShift[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBudget \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
