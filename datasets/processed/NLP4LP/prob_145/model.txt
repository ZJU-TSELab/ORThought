Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Van, 1 for Truck

Parameter:
1. ShoesPerVehicle
[50, 100] # Number of pairs of shoes each vehicle type can transport
2. MinShoes
2000 # Minimum number of pairs of shoes to be supplied

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the number of vans used.
min: \( x_{0} \)

Constraint:
1. Shoe supply constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ShoesPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinShoes \)
2. Truck to van ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \leq x_{0} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
