Set:
1. CurryType
The set of curry types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Goat, 1 for Chicken

Parameter:
1. CurryBaseUsage
[6, 5] # Units of curry base required for each curry type
2. GoatMeatUsage
3 # Units of goat meat required for a goat curry
3. ChickenMeatUsage
5 # Units of chicken meat required for a chicken curry
4. MaxGoatMeat
1500 # Units of goat meat available
5. MaxChickenMeat
2000 # Units of chicken meat available
6. MinChickenPercentage
0.25 # Minimum percentage of chicken curry bowls

Decision variable:
1. CurryBowlCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of curry bowls of type \( i \) to be made.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of curry base used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} CurryBaseUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Goat meat constraint
\( GoatMeatUsage \cdot x_{0} \leq MaxGoatMeat \)
2. Chicken meat constraint
\( ChickenMeatUsage \cdot x_{1} \leq MaxChickenMeat \)
3. Chicken percentage constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinChickenPercentage \cdot (x_{0} + x_{1}) \) which simplifies to \( 3 \cdot x_{1} \geq x_{0} \)
4. Popularity constraint
\( x_{0} \geq x_{1} + 1 \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
