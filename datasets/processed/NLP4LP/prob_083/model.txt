Set:
1. ReactionType
The set of chemical reaction types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Reaction A, 1 for Reaction B

Parameter:
1. InertGasRequirement
[5, 7] # Units of rare inert gas required for each reaction type
2. WaterRequirement
[6, 3] # Units of treated water required for each reaction type
3. CompoundProduction
[10, 8] # Units of rare compound produced by each reaction type
4. MaxInertGas
1000 # Units of rare inert gas available
5. MaxWater
800 # Units of treated water available

Decision variable:
1. ReactionCount
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each reaction is done.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of rare compound produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} CompoundProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Inert gas constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} InertGasRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxInertGas \)
2. Treated water constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WaterRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWater \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
