Set:
1. TransportType
The set of transportation types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for cart, 1 for trolley

Parameter:
1. Capacity
[5, 7] # kg/min transported by each type
2. Workers
[2, 4] # workers required for each type
3. MinTrolleys
12 # Minimum number of trolleys
4. MaxTrolleyCapacityProportion
0.4 # Maximum proportion of total capacity from trolleys
5. RequiredRate
100 # Required total transportation rate in kg/min

Decision variable:
1. NumTransport
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of each transport type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of workers.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} Workers[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} Capacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq RequiredRate \)
2. Minimum trolleys constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinTrolleys \)
3. Trolley capacity proportion constraint
\( Capacity[1] \cdot x_{1} \leq MaxTrolleyCapacityProportion \cdot (Capacity[0] \cdot x_{0} + Capacity[1] \cdot x_{1}) \)
4. Non-negativity and Integer
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \) and integer, for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
