Set:
1. RideType
The set of ride types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Taxi, 1 for Company Car

Parameter:
1. EmployeesPerRide
[2, 3] # Number of employees each ride type can take
2. MinEmployees
500 # Minimum number of employees to be transported
3. MaxCarRatio
0.6 # The number of company car rides cannot exceed 60% of the total rides
4. MinCarRides
30 # Minimum number of company car rides

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfRides
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of rides of each type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of taxi rides.
min: \( x_{0} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum employees constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} EmployeesPerRide[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinEmployees \)
2. Ride ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \leq \frac{MaxCarRatio}{1 - MaxCarRatio} \cdot x_{0} \)
3. Minimum car rides constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinCarRides \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
