Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Van, 1 for Minibus

Parameter:
1. KidsPerVehicle
[6, 10] # Number of kids each vehicle type can take
2. PollutionPerVehicle
[7, 10] # Units of pollution produced by each vehicle type
3. MinKids
150 # Minimum number of kids to be transported
4. MaxMinibuses
10 # Maximum number of minibuses that can be used

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of pollution produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Kid transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} KidsPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinKids \)
2. Maximum minibuses constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxMinibuses \)
3. Vans exceed minibuses constraint
\( x_{0} \geq x_{1} + 1 \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
