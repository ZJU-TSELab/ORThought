Set:
1. Factory
The set of factories, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Northern, 1 for Western

Parameter:
1. InjectionRate
[800, 650] # g of anti-itch injections produced per hour for each factory
2. CreamRate
[700, 750] # g of topical cream produced per hour for each factory
3. PlasticUsage
[40, 35] # units of plastic used per hour for each factory
4. MinInjections
800000 # Minimum g of anti-itch injections to be produced
5. MinCream
700000 # Minimum g of topical cream to be produced
6. PlasticLimit
60000 # Total units of plastic available

Decision variable:
1. HoursOfOperation
Continuous variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of hours each factory should be run.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum of the hours of operation for the two factories.
min: max(x_{0}, x_{1})

Constraint:
1. Injection Production
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{InjectionRate}[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq \text{MinInjections} \)
2. Cream Production
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{CreamRate}[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq \text{MinCream} \)
3. Plastic Usage
\( \sum_{i \in I} \text{PlasticUsage}[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq \text{PlasticLimit} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
