Set:
1. OilType
The set of oil types, \( I = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Light Oil, 1 for Non-sticky Oil, 2 for Heavy Oil

Parameter:
1. RevenuePerTank
[550, 750, 950] # Net revenue per tank for each oil type
2. CompoundAPerTank
[3, 6, 9] # Units of compound A required for each oil type
3. CompoundBPerTank
[3, 2, 3] # Units of compound B required for each oil type
4. MaxCompoundA
250 # Maximum available units of compound A
5. MaxCompoundB
150 # Maximum available units of compound B

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTanks
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of tanks of each oil type to process.

Objective:
Maximize the total net revenue.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} RevenuePerTank[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Compound A constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CompoundAPerTank[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCompoundA \)
2. Compound B constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CompoundBPerTank[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCompoundB \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
