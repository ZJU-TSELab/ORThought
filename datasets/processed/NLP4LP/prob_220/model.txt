Set:
1. GameType
The set of game types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for throwing, 1 for climbing

Parameter:
1. Customers
[15, 8] # Customers attracted per hour by each game type
2. PrizeCost
[2, 3] # Prize cost per hour for each game type
3. TotalPrizeBudget
100 # Maximum total prize cost per hour
4. MinClimbing
5 # Minimum number of climbing games

Decision variable:
1. NumGames
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of games of each type.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of customers attracted.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} Customers[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Prize budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PrizeCost[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq TotalPrizeBudget \)
2. Game ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq 2 \cdot x_{1} \)
3. Minimum climbing games constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinClimbing \)
4. Non-negativity and Integer
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \) and integer, for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
