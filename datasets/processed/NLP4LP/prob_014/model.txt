Set:
1. InvestmentType
The set of investment types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Apartments, 1 for Townhouses

Parameter:
1. TotalBudget
600000 # Total amount to invest
2. MaxApartmentInvestment
200000 # Maximum investment in apartments
3. ReturnRate
[0.10, 0.15] # Return rate for each investment type
4. ApartmentToTownhouseRatio
0.5 # Investment in apartments must be at least half of the investment in townhouses

Decision variable:
1. InvestmentAmount
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the amount of money invested in type \( t \).

Objective:
Maximize the total profit from investments.
max: \sum_{t \in T} ReturnRate[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Total budget constraint
\sum_{t \in T} x_{t} \leq TotalBudget
2. Apartment investment limit
x_{0} \leq MaxApartmentInvestment
3. Investment ratio constraint
x_{0} \geq ApartmentToTownhouseRatio * x_{1}
4. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, \forall t \in T

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
