Set:
1. BetType
The set of bet types, \( I = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Basketball, 1 for Horse Race, 2 for Soccer

Parameter:
1. LossChance
[0.5, 0.25, 0.1] # Chance of losing money for each bet type
2. PayoutPerDollar
[1.2, 0.5, 0.1] # Payout per dollar for each bet type
3. TotalBudget
100000 # Total amount of money to gamble
4. MaxAverageLossChance
0.3 # Maximum average chance of losing money

Decision variable:
1. AmountToBet
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the amount of money to bet on each sport.

Objective:
Maximize the average payout.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} (PayoutPerDollar[i] - 1) \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq TotalBudget \)
2. Average loss chance constraint
\( \frac{\sum_{i \in I} LossChance[i] \cdot x_{i}}{\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}} \leq MaxAverageLossChance \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
