Set:
1. CompanyType
The set of company types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for New Company, 1 for Old Company

Parameter:
1. GiftsPerTrip
[50, 70] # Number of gifts delivered per trip for each company type
2. DieselPerTrip
[30, 40] # Liters of diesel used per trip for each company type
3. MinGifts
1000 # Minimum number of gifts to be delivered
4. MaxNewCompanyTrips
15 # Maximum number of trips for the new company
5. MinOldCompanyTripProportion
0.40 # Minimum proportion of total trips that must be by the old company

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each company.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of diesel used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} DieselPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Gift delivery requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} GiftsPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinGifts \)
2. Maximum new company trips
\( x_{0} \leq MaxNewCompanyTrips \)
3. Old company trip proportion
\( x_{1} \geq MinOldCompanyTripProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
