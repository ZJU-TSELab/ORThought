Set:
1. MiningTechnique
The set of mining techniques, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Heap Leaching, 1 for Vat Leaching

Parameter:
1. REOProduction
[3, 5] # Tons of rare earth oxide produced per square mile by each technique
2. WastewaterProduction
[8, 17] # Tons of polluted wastewater created per square mile by each technique
3. MachineRequirement
[10, 20] # Extraction machines required per square mile by each technique
4. TotalLand
100 # Square miles of mining sites available
5. MaxWastewater
90 # Tons of polluted wastewater allowed daily
6. MaxMachines
100 # Extraction machines available

Decision variable:
1. LandToMine
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the square miles of land to be mined by each technique.

Objective:
Maximize the daily production of rare earth oxide.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} REOProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Land constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq TotalLand \)
2. Wastewater constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WastewaterProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWastewater \)
3. Machine constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MachineRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMachines \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
