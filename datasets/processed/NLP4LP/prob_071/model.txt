Set:
1. ShopSize
The set of butcher shop sizes, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small, 1 for Large

Parameter:
1. HotDogProduction
[30, 70] # Hot dogs made per day by each shop size
2. WorkerRequirement
[2, 4] # Workers required for each shop size
3. MinHotDogs
500 # Minimum total hot dogs to be made per day
4. MaxWorkers
30 # Maximum number of workers available

Decision variable:
1. ShopCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of shops of size \( i \) to be built.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of butcher shops.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Hot dog production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} HotDogProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinHotDogs \)
2. Worker availability constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WorkerRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWorkers \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
