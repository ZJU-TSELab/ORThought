Set:
1. ProductType
The set of product types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Laminate Planks, 1 for Carpets

Parameter:
1. MinDemand
[15000, 5000] # Minimum weekly demand in square feet for each product type
2. MaxProduction
[40000, 20000] # Maximum weekly production in square feet for each product type
3. MinTotalProduction
50000 # Minimum total weekly production in square feet
4. ProfitPerSqFt
[2.1, 3.3] # Profit per square foot for each product type

Decision variable:
1. ProductionAmount
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the square feet of each product type to produce.

Objective:
Maximize the total weekly profit.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProfitPerSqFt[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum demand constraint for Laminate Planks
\( x_{0} \geq MinDemand[0] \)
2. Minimum demand constraint for Carpets
\( x_{1} \geq MinDemand[1] \)
3. Maximum production constraint for Laminate Planks
\( x_{0} \leq MaxProduction[0] \)
4. Maximum production constraint for Carpets
\( x_{1} \leq MaxProduction[1] \)
5. Minimum total production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \geq MinTotalProduction \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
