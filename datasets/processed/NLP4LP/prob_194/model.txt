Set:
1. FoodType
The set of food types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Noodles, 1 for Protein Bars

Parameter:
1. CostPerServing
[5, 2.5] # Cost per serving for each food type
2. CaloriesPerServing
[600, 250] # Calories per serving for each food type
3. ProteinPerServing
[1.5, 5] # Grams of protein per serving for each food type
4. MinCalories
2000 # Minimum required calories
5. MinProtein
16 # Minimum required grams of protein

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfServings
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of servings of each food type to consume.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of the diet.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerServing[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Calorie constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CaloriesPerServing[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCalories \)
2. Protein constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ProteinPerServing[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinProtein \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
