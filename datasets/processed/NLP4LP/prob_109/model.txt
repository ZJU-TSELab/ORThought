Set:
1. MachineType
The set of machine types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Machine 1, 1 for Machine 2

Parameter:
1. HeartMedicine
[0.5, 0.3] # Units of medicine delivered to the heart per minute for each machine type
2. BrainMedicine
[0.8, 1.0] # Units of medicine delivered to the brain per minute for each machine type
3. Waste
[0.3, 0.5] # Units of waste produced per minute for each machine type
4. MaxHeartMedicine
8 # Maximum units of medicine for the heart
5. MinBrainMedicine
4 # Minimum units of medicine for the brain

Decision variable:
1. MachineUsage
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of minutes each machine is used.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of waste produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} Waste[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Heart medicine constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} HeartMedicine[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxHeartMedicine \)
2. Brain medicine constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BrainMedicine[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinBrainMedicine \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
