Set:
1. SanitizerType
The set of sanitizer types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for liquid, 1 for foam

Parameter:
1. WaterUsage
[40, 60] # Units of water required per sanitizer for each sanitizer type
2. AlcoholUsage
[50, 40] # Units of alcohol required per sanitizer for each sanitizer type
3. HandsCleaned
[30, 20] # Number of hands cleaned per sanitizer for each sanitizer type
4. MaxWater
2000 # Maximum units of water available
5. MaxAlcohol
2100 # Maximum units of alcohol available
6. MaxLiquidSanitizers
30 # Maximum number of liquid hand sanitizers to be made

Decision variable:
1. SanitizerCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of sanitizers of each type to be made.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of hands that can be cleaned.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} HandsCleaned[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Water constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WaterUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWater \)
2. Alcohol constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} AlcoholUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxAlcohol \)
3. Production relationship constraint
\( x_{1} \geq x_{0} + 1 \)
4. Maximum liquid sanitizers constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxLiquidSanitizers \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
