Set:
1. ProcessType
The set of process types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for process J, 1 for process P

Parameter:
1. MetalExtracted
[5, 9] # Units of metal extracted per process for each type
2. WaterUsed
[8, 6] # Units of water used per process for each type
3. PollutionProduced
[3, 5] # Units of pollution produced per process for each type
4. WaterAvailable
1500 # Total units of water available
5. PollutionLimit
1350 # Maximum units of pollution allowed

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfProcesses
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each process is performed.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of metal extracted.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} MetalExtracted[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Water availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} WaterUsed[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq WaterAvailable \)
2. Pollution limit
\( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionProduced[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq PollutionLimit \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
