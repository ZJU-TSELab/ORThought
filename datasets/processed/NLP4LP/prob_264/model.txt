Set:
1. ChemicalType
The set of chemical types, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Chemical A, 1 for Chemical B

Parameter:
1. EffectiveTime
[30, 45] # Seconds for each chemical to be effective
2. MinChemicalA
300 # Minimum units of Chemical A
3. MinTotalChemicals
1500 # Minimum total units of chemicals
4. ChemicalARatio
1/3 # Maximum ratio of Chemical A to Chemical B

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfUnits
Continuous variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of units of each chemical to be added.

Objective:
Minimize the total time it takes for the mixed bread to be ready.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} EffectiveTime[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Chemical Ratio
\( x_{0} \leq ChemicalARatio \cdot x_{1} \)
2. Minimum Chemical A
\( x_{0} \geq MinChemicalA \)
3. Minimum Total Chemicals
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \geq MinTotalChemicals \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
