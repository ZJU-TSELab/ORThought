Set:
1. WorkbookType
The set of workbook types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Math Workbook, 1 for English Workbook

Parameter:
1. MinProduction
[40, 60] # Minimum number of workbooks to make for each type
2. MaxProduction
[140, 170] # Maximum number of workbooks to make for each type
3. MinTotalProduction
200 # Minimum total number of workbooks to send
4. ProfitPerWorkbook
[15, 17] # Profit per workbook for each type

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfWorkbooks
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of workbooks of each type to make.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProfitPerWorkbook[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum production constraint for Math Workbooks
\( x_{0} \geq MinProduction[0] \)
2. Minimum production constraint for English Workbooks
\( x_{1} \geq MinProduction[1] \)
3. Maximum production constraint for Math Workbooks
\( x_{0} \leq MaxProduction[0] \)
4. Maximum production constraint for English Workbooks
\( x_{1} \leq MaxProduction[1] \)
5. Minimum total production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \geq MinTotalProduction \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
