Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Truck, 1 for Van

Parameter:
1. PattiesPerVehicle
[1000, 500] # Number of patties each vehicle type can take
2. CostPerTrip
[300, 100] # Cost per trip for each vehicle type
3. MinPatties
50000 # Minimum number of patties to be shipped
4. MaxCost
12500 # Maximum budget available for shipment

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each vehicle type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of trips.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Patty shipment requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} PattiesPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinPatties \)
2. Budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCost \)
3. Truck to van ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
