Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Limousines, 1 for Buses

Parameter:
1. CapacityPerVehicle
[12, 18] # Number of people each vehicle type can carry
2. MinPeople
400 # Minimum number of people to transport
3. MinLimousineRatio
0.7 # Minimum ratio of limousines to total vehicles

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of vehicles used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CapacityPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinPeople \)
2. Limousine ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinLimousineRatio \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
