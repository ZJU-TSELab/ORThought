Set:
1. MealTypes
The set of meal types, \( M = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Turkey Dinner, 1 for Tuna Salad Sandwich

Parameter:
1. ProteinContent
[20, 18] # Grams per meal for each meal type
2. CarbContent
[30, 25] # Grams per meal for each meal type
3. FatContent
[12, 8] # Grams per meal for each meal type
4. MinProtein
150 # Minimum grams of protein required
5. MinCarbs
200 # Minimum grams of carbs required
6. MaxTurkeyProportion
0.40 # Maximum proportion of meals that can be Turkey Dinners

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfMeals
Integer variable, \( x_{m} \) for all \( m \in M \), representing the number of each meal to eat.

Objective:
Minimize total fat intake.
min: \( \sum_{m \in M} FatContent[m] \cdot x_{m} \)

Constraint:
1. Protein requirement
\( \sum_{m \in M} ProteinContent[m] \cdot x_{m} \geq MinProtein \)
2. Carbohydrate requirement
\( \sum_{m \in M} CarbContent[m] \cdot x_{m} \geq MinCarbs \)
3. Turkey dinner proportion
\( x_{0} \leq MaxTurkeyProportion \cdot \sum_{m \in M} x_{m} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{m} \geq 0 \), for all \( m \in M \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
