Set:
1. CrateType
The set of crate types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Crate, 1 for Large Crate

Parameter:
1. GrapesPerCrate
[200, 500] # Number of grapes each crate type can hold
2. MaxAvailableCrates
[100, 50] # Maximum number of available crates for each type
3. SmallToLargeRatio
3 # The number of small crates must be at least three times the number of large crates
4. MaxTotalCrates
60 # Maximum total number of crates that can be transported
5. MinLargeCrates
10 # Minimum number of large crates to be used

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfCrates
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of crates of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of grapes that can be transported.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} GrapesPerCrate[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Maximum small crates constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxAvailableCrates[0] \)
2. Maximum large crates constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxAvailableCrates[1] \)
3. Crate ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq SmallToLargeRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Total crates constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq MaxTotalCrates \)
5. Minimum large crates constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLargeCrates \)
6. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
