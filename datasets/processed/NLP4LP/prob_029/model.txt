Set:
1. CropType
The set of crop types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Potatoes, 1 for Cucumbers

Parameter:
1. TotalLand
50 # Total acres of land available
2. MinAcres
[12, 15] # Minimum acres to grow for each crop type
3. ProfitPerAcre
[500, 650] # Profit per acre for each crop type
4. MaxCucumberRatio
2 # Maximum ratio of cucumber acres to potato acres

Decision variable:
1. AcresToGrow
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the acres of crop type \( t \) to grow.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \sum_{t \in T} ProfitPerAcre[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Total land constraint
\sum_{t \in T} x_{t} \leq TotalLand
2. Minimum acres constraint
x_{t} \geq MinAcres[t], for all \( t \in T \)
3. Cucumber to potato ratio constraint
x_{1} \leq MaxCucumberRatio * x_{0}
4. Preference constraint (more cucumbers than potatoes)
x_{1} \geq x_{0}
5. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
