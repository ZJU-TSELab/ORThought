Set:
1. PerformerType
The set of performer types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Otter, 1 for Dolphin

Parameter:
1. TricksPerPerformer
[3, 1] # Number of tricks performed by each performer type
2. TreatsPerPerformer
[3, 5] # Number of treats required by each performer type
3. MaxTreats
200 # Maximum number of treats available
4. MinDolphins
10 # Minimum number of dolphins to be used
5. MaxOtterProportion
0.30 # Maximum proportion of performers that can be otters

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfPerformers
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of performers of each type.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of tricks that can be performed.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} TricksPerPerformer[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Treats constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} TreatsPerPerformer[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxTreats \)
2. Minimum dolphins constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinDolphins \)
3. Otter proportion constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxOtterProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
