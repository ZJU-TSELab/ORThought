Set:
1. ProcessType
The set of process types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for with catalyst, 1 for without a catalyst

Parameter:
1. WoodRequirement
[10, 15] # Units of wood required for each process type
2. OxygenRequirement
[20, 12] # Units of oxygen required for each process type
3. CO2Production
[15, 18] # Units of carbon dioxide produced by each process type
4. MaxWood
300 # Units of wood available
5. MaxOxygen
300 # Units of oxygen available

Decision variable:
1. ProcessCount
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each process is used.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} CO2Production[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Wood constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WoodRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWood \)
2. Oxygen constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} OxygenRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxOxygen \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
