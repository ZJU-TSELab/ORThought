Set:
1. BusType
The set of bus types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Small Bus, 1 for Large Bus

Parameter:
1. StudentsPerBus
[20, 50] # Number of students each bus type can carry
2. MinStudents
500 # Minimum number of students to be transported
3. MaxLargeBusProportion
0.20 # Maximum proportion of buses that can be large

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfBuses
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of buses of each type to hire.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of buses.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Student transportation requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} StudentsPerBus[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinStudents \)
2. Large bus proportion constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxLargeBusProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
