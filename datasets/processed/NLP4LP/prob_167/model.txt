Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Bike, 1 for Car

Parameter:
1. PeoplePerVehicle
[3, 5] # Number of people each vehicle type can transport
2. MinTotalPeople
500 # Minimum total number of people to be transported
3. MaxCarRatio
0.4 # The number of cars cannot exceed 40% of the total vehicles

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of bikes needed.
min: \( x_{0} \)

Constraint:
1. Minimum people constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeoplePerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalPeople \)
2. Vehicle ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \leq \frac{MaxCarRatio}{1 - MaxCarRatio} \cdot x_{0} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
