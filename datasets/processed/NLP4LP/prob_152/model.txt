Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Helicopter, 1 for Truck

Parameter:
1. CowsPerVehicle
[3, 7] # Number of cows each vehicle type can transport
2. PollutionPerTrip
[5, 10] # Units of pollution created per trip for each vehicle type
3. MinCows
80 # Minimum number of cows to be transported
4. MaxTruckTrips
8 # Maximum number of truck trips allowed

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each vehicle type.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of pollution produced.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} PollutionPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Cow transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} CowsPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCows \)
2. Maximum truck trips
\( x_{1} \leq MaxTruckTrips \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
