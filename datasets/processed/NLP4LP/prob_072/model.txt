Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for 4-wheeler, 1 for 3-wheeler

Parameter:
1. LuggageCapacity
[60, 40] # Luggage moved per day by each vehicle type
2. PollutantProduction
[30, 15] # Units of pollutant produced per day by each vehicle type
3. MinLuggage
1000 # Minimum total luggage to be moved per day
4. MaxPollution
430 # Maximum total units of pollutant allowed per day

Decision variable:
1. VehicleCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of type \( i \) to be bought.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of vehicles.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Luggage capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} LuggageCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinLuggage \)
2. Pollution constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PollutantProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPollution \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
