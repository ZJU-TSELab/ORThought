Set:
1. BeakerType
The set of beaker types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Beaker 1, 1 for Beaker 2

Parameter:
1. FlourUsage
[4, 6] # Units of flour used by each beaker type
2. LiquidUsage
[6, 3] # Units of special liquid used by each beaker type
3. SlimeProduction
[5, 3] # Units of slime produced by each beaker type
4. WasteProduction
[4, 2] # Units of waste produced by each beaker type
5. MaxFlour
150 # Maximum units of flour available
6. MaxLiquid
100 # Maximum units of special liquid available
7. MaxWaste
30 # Maximum units of waste allowed

Decision variable:
1. BeakerCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of times each beaker type is used.

Objective:
Maximize the total amount of slime produced.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} SlimeProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Flour constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} FlourUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxFlour \)
2. Liquid constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} LiquidUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxLiquid \)
3. Waste constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WasteProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxWaste \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
