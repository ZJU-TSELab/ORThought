Set:
1. FarmType
The set of farm types, \( F = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Old Farm, 1 for New Farm
2. BerryType
The set of berry types, \( B = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Raspberries, 1 for Blueberries, 2 for Strawberries

Parameter:
1. CostPerDay
[300, 200] # Cost to operate per day for each farm type
2. HarvestPerDay
[[2, 4], [2, 1], [4, 2]] # kg of each berry type harvested per day from each farm type
3. Demand
[10, 9, 15] # kg of each berry type required by the contract

Decision variable:
1. DaysToOperate
Continuous variable, \( x_{f} \) for all \( f \in F \), representing the number of days to operate farm type \( f \).

Objective:
Minimize the total operating cost.
min: \sum_{f \in F} CostPerDay[f] * x_{f}

Constraint:
1. Demand satisfaction constraint
\sum_{f \in F} HarvestPerDay[b][f] * x_{f} \geq Demand[b], for all \( b \in B \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{f} \geq 0, for all \( f \in F \)

Type:
continuous, linear, linear
