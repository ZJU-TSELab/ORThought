Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Scooter, 1 for Rickshaw

Parameter:
1. PeoplePerVehicle
[2, 3] # Number of people each vehicle type can carry
2. MinVisitors
300 # Minimum number of visitors to be transported
3. MaxRickshawProportion
0.40 # Maximum proportion of vehicles that can be rickshaws

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of scooters used.
min: \( x_{0} \)

Constraint:
1. Visitor transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} PeoplePerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinVisitors \)
2. Rickshaw proportion constraint
\( x_{1} \leq MaxRickshawProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
