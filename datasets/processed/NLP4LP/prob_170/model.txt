Set:
1. TripType
The set of trip types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Submarine, 1 for Boat

Parameter:
1. MailPerTrip
[100, 80] # Pieces of mail each vehicle type can carry per trip
2. GasPerTrip
[30, 25] # Liters of gas used for each trip type
3. MaxSubmarineTrips
6 # Maximum number of submarine trips
4. MinBoatRatio
0.5 # The number of boat trips must be at least 50% of the total trips
5. MinTotalMail
1000 # Minimum total pieces of mail to be transported

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips of each type.

Objective:
Minimize the total amount of gas used.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} GasPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Maximum submarine trips constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxSubmarineTrips \)
2. Minimum mail constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MailPerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalMail \)
3. Trip ratio constraint
\( x_{1} \geq x_{0} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
