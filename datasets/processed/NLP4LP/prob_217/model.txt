Set:
1. LiftType
The set of ski lift types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for densely-seated, 1 for loosely-seated

Parameter:
1. Capacity
[45, 20] # Guest capacity per minute for each lift type
2. Electricity
[30, 22] # Electricity units required for each lift type
3. MinTotalCapacity
1000 # Minimum total guest capacity per minute required
4. MaxTotalElectricity
940 # Maximum total electricity units available
5. MinLooselySeated
5 # Minimum number of loosely-seated lifts required

Decision variable:
1. NumLifts
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of lifts of each type to install.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of ski lifts.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Total capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} Capacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinTotalCapacity \)
2. Total electricity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} Electricity[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxTotalElectricity \)
3. Loosely-seated minimum constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinLooselySeated \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{0} \geq 0 \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
