Set:
1. CropType
The set of crop types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Turnips, 1 for Pumpkins
2. ResourceType
The set of resource types, \( R = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Land, 1 for Watering, 2 for Pesticide

Parameter:
1. RevenuePerAcre
[300, 450] # Revenue per acre for each crop type
2. ResourceAvailability
[500, 40000, 34000] # Available amount for each resource type (acres, minutes, dollars)
3. ResourceConsumption
[[1, 1], [50, 90], [80, 50]] # Resource consumption per acre for each crop type

Decision variable:
1. AcresToGrow
Continuous variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the acres of crop type \( t \) to grow.

Objective:
Maximize the total revenue.
max: \sum_{t \in T} RevenuePerAcre[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Resource availability constraint
\sum_{t \in T} ResourceConsumption[r][t] * x_{t} \leq ResourceAvailability[r], for all \( r \in R \)
2. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
