Set:
1. FoodType
The set of food types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Hamburger, 1 for Chicken Wrap

Parameter:
1. CostPerFood
[6.5, 4] # Cost of each food type
2. CaloriesPerFood
[800, 450] # Calories in each food type
3. ProteinPerFood
[19, 12] # Grams of protein in each food type
4. CarbsPerFood
[20, 10] # Grams of carbs in each food type
5. MinCalories
2200 # Minimum required calories
6. MinProtein
50 # Minimum required grams of protein
7. MinCarbs
70 # Minimum required grams of carbs

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfFood
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the quantity of each food type to purchase.

Objective:
Minimize the total cost of the diet.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerFood[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Calorie constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CaloriesPerFood[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCalories \)
2. Protein constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ProteinPerFood[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinProtein \)
3. Carbs constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CarbsPerFood[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinCarbs \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
