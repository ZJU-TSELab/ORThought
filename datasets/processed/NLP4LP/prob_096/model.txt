Set:
1. MealType
The set of meal types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for fish, 1 for chicken

Parameter:
1. Protein
[10, 15] # Units of protein per meal for each meal type
2. Iron
[12, 8] # Units of iron per meal for each meal type
3. Fat
[7, 10] # Units of fat per meal for each meal type
4. MinProtein
130 # Minimum units of protein required
5. MinIron
120 # Minimum units of iron required
6. ChickenToFishRatio
2 # Minimum ratio of chicken meals to fish meals

Decision variable:
1. MealCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of meals of type \( i \) to be eaten.

Objective:
Minimize the total fat intake.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} Fat[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Protein requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} Protein[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinProtein \)
2. Iron requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} Iron[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinIron \)
3. Preference constraint
\( x_{1} \geq ChickenToFishRatio \cdot x_{0} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
IP
