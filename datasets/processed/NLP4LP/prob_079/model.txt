Set:
1. WorkerType
The set of worker types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Full-time, 1 for Part-time

Parameter:
1. HoursPerShift
[8, 4] # Hours worked per shift by each worker type
2. CostPerShift
[300, 100] # Dollars paid per shift to each worker type
3. MinHours
500 # Minimum total hours of labor required
4. MaxBudget
15000 # Dollars available in the budget

Decision variable:
1. WorkerCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of workers of type \( i \) to be scheduled.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of workers.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Labor hours constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} HoursPerShift[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinHours \)
2. Budget constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CostPerShift[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBudget \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
