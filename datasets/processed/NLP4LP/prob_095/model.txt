Set:
1. FactoryType
The set of factory types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Factory 1, 1 for Factory 2

Parameter:
1. AllergyPillProduction
[20, 10] # Allergy pills produced per hour by each factory type
2. FeverPillProduction
[15, 30] # Fever reducing pills produced per hour by each factory type
3. CompoundUsage
[20, 30] # Units of rare compound used per hour by each factory type
4. MinAllergyPills
700 # Minimum number of allergy pills to be produced
5. MinFeverPills
600 # Minimum number of fever reducing pills to be produced
6. MaxCompound
1000 # Maximum units of rare compound available

Decision variable:
1. FactoryHours
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of hours each factory is run.
2. MaxHour
Continuous variable, \( z \), representing the maximum of the factory hours.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum of the factory hours.
min: \( z \)

Constraint:
1. Allergy pill production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} AllergyPillProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinAllergyPills \)
2. Fever pill production constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} FeverPillProduction[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinFeverPills \)
3. Rare compound constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CompoundUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCompound \)
4. Max hour constraint
\( z \geq x_{i} \), for all \( i \in I \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)
\( z \geq 0 \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
