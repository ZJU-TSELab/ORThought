Set:
1. CoffeeType
The set of coffee types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Mocha, 1 for Regular Coffee

Parameter:
1. CoffeePowderRequirement
[3, 6] # Units of coffee powder required for each coffee type
2. MilkRequirement
[6, 2] # Units of milk required for each coffee type
3. ProductionTime
[5, 3] # Minutes to make each coffee type
4. MaxCoffeePowder
400 # Units of coffee powder available
5. MaxMilk
500 # Units of milk available
6. MochaToRegularRatio
3 # Minimum ratio of mochas to regular coffees

Decision variable:
1. CoffeeCount
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of coffees of type \( i \) to be made.

Objective:
Minimize the total production time.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProductionTime[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Coffee powder constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} CoffeePowderRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCoffeePowder \)
2. Milk constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MilkRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMilk \)
3. Mocha to regular ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MochaToRegularRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
