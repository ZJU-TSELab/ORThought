Set:
1. FoodType
The set of food types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for apple, 1 for carrot

Parameter:
1. Fat
[2, 4] # Units of fat per serving for each food type
2. Folate
[5, 3] # Units of folate per serving for each food type
3. MaxFolate
100 # Maximum units of folate allowed
4. MinCarrotServings
2 # Minimum number of carrot flavored baby food servings
5. AppleToCarrotRatio
3 # Ratio of apple flavored baby food to carrot flavored baby food

Decision variable:
1. FoodServings
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of servings of each food type.

Objective:
Maximize the total fat intake.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} Fat[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Folate constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} Folate[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxFolate \)
2. Preference constraint
\( x_{0} = AppleToCarrotRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
3. Minimum carrot servings constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinCarrotServings \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
LP
