Set:
1. PipeType
The set of pipe types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for wide, 1 for narrow

Parameter:
1. WaterCapacity
[25, 15] # Water transport capacity in units per minute for each pipe type
2. MinWaterTransport
900 # Minimum total water to be transported per minute
3. MinWidePipes
5 # Minimum number of wide pipes to be used
4. WideToNarrowRatio
1/3 # The number of wide pipes can be at most a third of the number of narrow pipes

Decision variable:
1. NumPipes
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of each pipe type to be used.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of pipes.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Water capacity constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} WaterCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinWaterTransport \)
2. Minimum wide pipes constraint
\( x_{0} \geq MinWidePipes \)
3. Pipe ratio constraint
\( x_{0} \leq WideToNarrowRatio \cdot x_{1} \), which simplifies to \( 3x_{0} \leq x_{1} \)
4. Non-negativity and Integer
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \) and integer, for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
