Set:
1. TransportMethod
The set of transport methods, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Camel Caravan, 1 for Desert Truck

Parameter:
1. GoodsCapacity
[50, 150] # Units of goods each transport method can deliver per trip
2. TimePerTrip
[12, 5] # Hours per trip for each transport method
3. MinGoods
1500 # Minimum units of goods to be delivered

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of trips for each transport method.

Objective:
Minimize the maximum of the total hours required by each transport method.
min: max(\( TimePerTrip[0] \cdot x_{0} \), \( TimePerTrip[1] \cdot x_{1} \))

Constraint:
1. Goods Delivery
\( \sum_{i \in I} GoodsCapacity[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinGoods \)
2. Transport Preference
\( x_{0} > x_{1} \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
