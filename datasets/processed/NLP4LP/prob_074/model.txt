Set:
1. FishingMethod
The set of fishing methods, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Net, 1 for Fishing Line

Parameter:
1. FishCatch
[8, 5] # Fish caught per acre by each method
2. BaitRequirement
[4, 3] # Units of bait required per acre by each method
3. PainCaused
[2, 1] # Units of pain caused per acre by each method
4. TotalAcres
250 # Acres of the lake available for fishing
5. MaxBait
800 # Units of bait available
6. MaxPain
350 # Units of pain the fisherman can tolerate

Decision variable:
1. AcresToFish
Continuous variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of acres to be fished by each method.

Objective:
Maximize the amount of fish he can catch.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} FishCatch[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Lake area constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \leq TotalAcres \)
2. Bait constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BaitRequirement[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBait \)
3. Pain constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} PainCaused[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxPain \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Continuous, linear, linear
