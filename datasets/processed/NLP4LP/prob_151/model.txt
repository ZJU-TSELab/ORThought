Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Bus, 1 for Car

Parameter:
1. MonkeysPerVehicle
[20, 6] # Number of monkeys each vehicle type can transport
2. TimePerTrip
[30, 15] # Minutes per trip for each vehicle type
3. MinMonkeys
300 # Minimum number of monkeys to be transported
4. MaxBusTrips
10 # Maximum number of bus trips allowed
5. MinCarTripProportion
0.60 # Minimum proportion of total trips that must be by car

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfTrips
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of trips for each vehicle type.

Objective:
Minimize the total time required to transport the monkeys.
min: \( \sum_{i \in I} TimePerTrip[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Monkey transport requirement
\( \sum_{i \in I} MonkeysPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \geq MinMonkeys \)
2. Maximum bus trips
\( x_{0} \leq MaxBusTrips \)
3. Car trip proportion
\( x_{1} \geq MinCarTripProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
