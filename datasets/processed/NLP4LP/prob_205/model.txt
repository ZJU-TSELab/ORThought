Set:
1. CakeType
The set of cake types, \( I = \{0, 1, 2\} \) # 0 for Crepe Cake, 1 for Sponge Cake, 2 for Birthday Cake

Parameter:
1. BatterPerCake
[400, 500, 450] # Grams of batter required for each cake type
2. MilkPerCake
[200, 300, 350] # Grams of milk required for each cake type
3. MaxBatter
20000 # Maximum available batter in grams
4. MaxMilk
14000 # Maximum available milk in grams
5. ProfitPerCake
[12, 10, 15] # Profit per cake for each type

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfCakes
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of cakes of each type to make.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} ProfitPerCake[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Batter constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} BatterPerCake[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxBatter \)
2. Milk constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} MilkPerCake[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxMilk \)
3. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
