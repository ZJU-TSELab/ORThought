Set:
1. VehicleType
The set of vehicle types, \( I = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Bike, 1 for Scooter

Parameter:
1. MealsPerVehicle
[8, 5] # Number of meals each vehicle type can hold
2. ChargePerVehicle
[3, 2] # Units of charge required by each vehicle type
3. MaxCharge
200 # Maximum units of charge available
4. MinScooters
20 # Minimum number of scooters to be used
5. MaxBikeProportion
0.30 # Maximum proportion of vehicles that can be bikes

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfVehicles
Integer variable, \( x_{i} \) for all \( i \in I \), representing the number of vehicles of each type to use.

Objective:
Maximize the number of meals that can be delivered.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} MealsPerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Charge constraint
\( \sum_{i \in I} ChargePerVehicle[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq MaxCharge \)
2. Minimum scooters constraint
\( x_{1} \geq MinScooters \)
3. Bike proportion constraint
\( x_{0} \leq MaxBikeProportion \cdot \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)
4. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
