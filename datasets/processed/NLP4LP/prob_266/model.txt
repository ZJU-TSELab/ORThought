Set:
1. KeyboardType
The set of keyboard types, I = {0, 1} # 0 for Mechanical, 1 for Standard

Parameter:
1. PlasticUsage
[5, 2] # Units of plastic per keyboard for each type
2. SolderUsage
[2, 1] # Units of solder per keyboard for each type
3. PlasticAvailable
1000 # Total units of plastic available
4. SolderAvailable
250 # Total units of solder available
5. MinStandardKeyboards
30 # Minimum number of standard keyboards to be manufactured
6. MechanicalToStandardRatio
5 # The ratio of mechanical keyboards to standard keyboards

Decision variable:
1. NumberOfKeyboards
Integer variable, x_{i} for all i in I, representing the number of keyboards of each type to be manufactured.

Objective:
Maximize the total number of keyboards.
max: \( \sum_{i \in I} x_{i} \)

Constraint:
1. Plastic Availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} PlasticUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq PlasticAvailable \)
2. Solder Availability
\( \sum_{i \in I} SolderUsage[i] \cdot x_{i} \leq SolderAvailable \)
3. Production Ratio
\( x_{0} = MechanicalToStandardRatio \cdot x_{1} \)
4. Minimum Standard Keyboards
\( x_{1} \geq MinStandardKeyboards \)
5. Non-negativity
\( x_{i} \geq 0 \), for all \( i \in I \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
