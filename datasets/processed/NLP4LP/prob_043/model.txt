Set:
1. SawType
The set of saw types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Miter Saw, 1 for Circular Saw

Parameter:
1. PlanksCutPerDay
[50, 70] # Planks of wood cut per day by each saw type
2. SawdustProducedPerDay
[60, 100] # Units of sawdust produced per day by each saw type
3. MinPlanksToCut
1500 # Minimum planks to cut per day
4. MaxSawdustAllowed
2000 # Maximum units of sawdust allowed per day

Decision variable:
1. SawCount
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of saws of type \( t \) to purchase.

Objective:
Minimize the total number of saws needed.
min: \sum_{t \in T} x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Wood cutting constraint
\sum_{t \in T} PlanksCutPerDay[t] * x_{t} \geq MinPlanksToCut
2. Sawdust production constraint
\sum_{t \in T} SawdustProducedPerDay[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxSawdustAllowed
3. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
