Set:
1. DeskType
The set of desk types, \( T = \{0, 1\} \) # 0 for Long Desks, 1 for Short Desks

Parameter:
1. MaxBudget
2000 # Maximum budget in dollars
2. MaxSpace
200 # Maximum space for desks in square feet
3. Cost
[300, 100] # Cost per desk type
4. Space
[10, 4] # Space taken up per desk type in square feet
5. Seating
[6, 2] # Number of employees seated per desk type

Decision variable:
1. DeskCount
Integer variable, \( x_{t} \) for all \( t \in T \), representing the number of desks of type \( t \) to buy.

Objective:
Maximize the total seating availability.
max: \sum_{t \in T} Seating[t] * x_{t}

Constraint:
1. Budget constraint
\sum_{t \in T} Cost[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxBudget
2. Space constraint
\sum_{t \in T} Space[t] * x_{t} \leq MaxSpace
3. Non-negativity
x_{t} \geq 0, for all \( t \in T \)

Type:
Integer, linear, linear
